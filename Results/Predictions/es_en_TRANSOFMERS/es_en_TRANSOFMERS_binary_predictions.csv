2006/s/pv_5492/42:1	The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon -- which was certified by this Council six years ago -- would result in security along its northern border, are subjected to constant rocket attacks by Hezbollah, which increasingly penetrate Israeli territory.
2004/s/pv_5025/228:5	The number of attacks against national and international security forces, officials of public institutions and humanitarian personnel has increased, and attacks on polling stations and threats against registration teams have increased.
2009/s/pv_6111/60:4	This became clear in the recent incidents of DIS indiscipline, namely the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March.
2010/s/pv_6276/309:2	We note that the enduring challenges faced by the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.
2003/s/pv_4770/137:1	At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they adopted a more participatory attitude, rather than withdrawing from the legislature when faced with a difficult situation.
2004/s/pv_5025/229:2	We should not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al-Qaida.
2011/s/pv_6656/57:2	Although neither side seems willing to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation of tension and destabilization that could lead to large-scale confrontation and endanger the lives of civilians.
2003/s/pv_4770/140:2	Nevertheless, the situation within Kosovo is still worrying.
2010/s/pv_6353/179:1	Like other speakers who preceded us and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzeković and the wounding of others during the protests that took place on 2 July in northern Mitrovica.
2007/s/pv_5718/35:1	The meeting was called to order at 11.25 a.m.
2004/s/pv_5049/151:1	We urge Israel to cease its military incursions into Gaza.
2012/s/pv_6735/124:3	South Africa stresses that, given the magnitude of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy incorporating security, humanitarian assistance, good governance and socio-economic development is needed.
2012/s/pv_6709/56:1	Recent developments in the region confirm the concerns systematically conveyed to the mission by its interlocutors.
2007/s/pv_5693/199:1	We have also noted that the spiral of violence has forced entire populations to move to escape violence.
2004/s/pv_5049/186:2	Those acts were absolutely unacceptable; the Palestinian Authority must put an end to such attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.
2007/s/pv_5693/252:1	During our previous debate, Belgium had shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General about the dangers posed by violence in Iraq to a society, institutions and political process that remain fragile.
2004/s/pv_5049/138:2	We urge the Palestinian Authority to make every effort to put an end to these attacks.
2010/s/pv_6276/216:1	In conclusion, while Timor-Leste has made significant progress, it still faces many serious challenges in its efforts to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy.
2008/s/pv_6049/252:5	The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.
2009/s/pv_6230/187:2	This is obviously because the States concerned rejected their measures.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/387:2	It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a leading role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the conflict prevention process.
2010/s/pv_6365/52:4	However, challenges remain on the road to lasting peace and stabilization in Darfur.
2003/s/pv_4770/171:4	These actions have been undertaken in spite of the clear position taken against them by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and in defiance of the provisions of the United Nations and the Security Council.
2004/s/pv_5025/124:2	The alarming situation with regard to drug trafficking calls for other measures.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/233:1	The challenge is to ensure that our outrage is translated into determined and determined action that bears rapid and measurable fruit.
2008/s/pv_5855/254:4	They insist on treating the case as a simple immigration offence.
2012/s/pv_6734/97:2	I repeat again today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710), it is unacceptable that the Council should be prevented from assuming its responsibilities.
2012/s/pv_6734/168:2	His mission represents the last opportunity to prevent a crisis from unfolding in Syria.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/353:5	This occurred despite repeated condemnations of these inhumane acts in Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which became beacons of hope for millions of women and girls who were abused worldwide.
2012/s/pv_6734/66:5	The second is to call once again, as a matter of urgency, for the Security Council to take essential steps to stop the bloodshed in Syria.
2004/s/pv_5049/273:1	Faced with this clear situation of threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without the double standards that characterize it on this subject and adopt, urgently and decisively, the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the countries that make up the Arab Group.
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/40:1	The President (spoke in Spanish): In accordance with the usual practice, I would like to remind all speakers to limit their statements to a maximum of five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work diligently.
2004/s/pv_5025/324:2	In our view, it is not cross-border infiltrations that are resulting in extremist violence in Afghanistan, including in the south and south-east.
2010/s/pv_6431/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4.10 p.m.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/253:1	The report before us is a difficult reading, but it also sets a challenge.
2012/s/pv_6734/291:1	In conclusion, in the context of world peace and the Middle East, I would like to stress that, while we understand all the different needs emanating from security, it would be better for that region and the entire world to avoid the situation in Iran becoming a conflict, because it would be the kind of conflict that would have a very regrettable impact on the world and could be the straw that filled the glass -- as the proverb says -- of world peace.
2004/s/pv_5049/153:1	We are deeply concerned that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated against each other, despite the fact that the international community and the Security Council have clearly expressed their abhorrence of that situation.
2010/s/pv_6276/176:3	In order to complete the transfer process, a number of logistical requirements must be met.
2005/s/pv_5188/317:3	Given its current political status, Kosovo remains far from foreign direct investment and does not qualify for the programmes and assistance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which would have a direct impact on the development of a stable and efficient economy.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/215:4	This is an important step in the right direction.
2011/s/pv_6656/56:3	Furthermore, tensions at the border could lead to serious violence during the migration period, particularly in the Abyei Area, from which neither side has fully withdrawn.
2005/s/pv_5188/97:3	This would entail stronger measures with regard to the eviction of those who, with the threat of violence, are using Serbian property illegally.
2012/s/pv_6734/71:2	The first is that the demands for human rights and freedom are universal and will extend for themselves over time, as they are fundamental human aspirations.
2012/s/pv_6729/195:7	We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by the most active elements in that trade.
2012/s/pv_6734/172:6	Israel has legitimate security concerns, but these can only be addressed fully effectively through a negotiated agreement.
2004/s/pv_5024/230:1	At the same time, we are concerned by the observation in the report that the work on the demarcation of the land border between Timor-Leste and Indonesia is not proceeding expeditiously.
2008/s/pv_6024/65:2	This is important in strengthening the Mission's capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, which is the victim of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as stressed by Mr. Doss, and of massive human rights violations, including acts of violence directed against women and children.
2004/s/pv_5025/185:1	Given its role as a leading country in these efforts, the United Kingdom knows, perhaps better than others sitting around this table, how immense the long-term challenge of the fight against drugs is.
2012/s/pv_6734/114:2	That is why I have focused more on the part of the opportunities than on the challenges in my speech.
2008/s/pv_6049/220:1	Measures that could weaken confidence or damage the outcome of negotiations should be suspended and reversed.
2008/s/pv_6049/219:4	The siege must be lifted immediately so that the civilian population in Gaza can have access, essentially, to water, jobs, trade, medical care and education, in short, access to their basic needs.
2012/s/pv_6729/263:1	I would like to remind speakers that they should limit their statements to a maximum of four minutes so that the Council can carry out its work expeditiously.
2007/s/pv_5693/218:1	My delegation is concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.
2012/s/pv_6729/151:3	We must reject any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.
2007/s/pv_5693/92:3	Terrorists have therefore failed to achieve their strategic goal of preventing many volunteers from coming to rebuild the country.
2012/s/pv_6734/135:3	We were even hampered in condemning the violence and in adopting a peaceful plan drawn up by Syria's own neighbours.
2011/s/pv_6656/93:1	The fact that both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, use rhetoric intensively, is a matter of concern.
2004/s/pv_5049/247:1	Egypt once again demands that Israel immediately cease its attacks on Gaza.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/246:3	The statement outlines issues of concern, and towards its end the urgent appeal of Somali women to the international community to raise gender issues, including Somali leaders, is welcomed.
2010/s/pv_6276/185:1	Despite overall progress, it should be noted that poverty and unemployment remain a formidable challenge, as highlighted by Ms. Ameerah Haq.
2004/s/pv_5024/255:2	We are gravely concerned that the special processes created for that purpose appear to have failed.
2011/s/pv_6495/51:2	However, the challenges involved will be much greater, as they will constitute one-day events, and logistics will be hampered by Liberia's heavy rainy season.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/252:2	However, Chad's experience left a strong imprint on our peacekeeping forces and increased awareness of the challenge facing the United Nations in that regard.
2012/s/pv_6734/111:4	Combating that scourge requires strengthening our criminal prosecution capacity, our judicial system, our civilian police and even our prison system.
2010/s/pv_6276/257:2	We have noted with concern that the Secretary-General believes that many of the factors fuelling the 2006 crisis remain present in society, making it vulnerable to instability.
2011/s/pv_6490/42:1	We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have noticed in my statement this morning.
2002/s/pv_4583/45:2	It also stresses that Rwanda has an obligation to use its great influence to ensure that RCD-Goma does not carry out any of these actions.
2010/s/pv_6297/68:1	National security forces are not yet in a position to respond to these threats in remote areas because of their limited capacity.
2012/s/pv_6708/46:4	The important challenges and challenges related to security and national reconciliation, which, in my view, require the political attention of the Council, should not be underestimated.
2008/s/pv_5855/260:2	Pursuant to those resolutions, this body must demand that the Government of the United States immediately try Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice he has been demanding for years.
2011/s/pv_6618/154:2	The Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations should make greater efforts in prevention activities, such as the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation.
2011/s/pv_6544/46:1	 The Security Council expresses grave concern at reports of the unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriyas into and around Abyei City, a phenomenon that could force significant changes in the ethnic composition of the area.",1,0.9107579163142613

2002/s/pv_4583/49:1," The Security Council also expresses its concern at the growing tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint.
2011/s/pv_6579/65:4	The state of the Blue Nile remains a concern for us.
2008/s/pv_5855/341:4	Therefore, United Nations bodies engaged in the fight against terrorism should address these fissures more seriously and with greater dedication.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/419:2	In fact, Azerbaijan itself violates those resolutions, in which the parties concerned are urged to engage in negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as through various contacts between them.
2011/s/pv_6656/51:2	I expressed the deep concern of this Council and the Secretary-General at the recent increase in tensions between the north and the south, as well as at the continuing lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.
2009/s/pv_6230/111:1	The Russian Federation expresses its deep regret and concern at the information regarding the persistence of violence in Darfur.
2012/s/pv_6734/58:4	I am very concerned about the latest escalation between Gaza and Israel.
2004/s/pv_5025/281:4	It is clear that these circumstances represent the greatest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and that, if allowed to continue, they threaten to undermine the progress achieved over almost three years.
2004/s/pv_5025/127:1	Promoting security and stability remains a key challenge.
2011/s/pv_6495/55:2	However, the process has also highlighted how important the challenges remain in Liberia's security sector, especially with regard to the logistics, communications and mobility capabilities of the police and immigration services.
2012/s/pv_6709/64:1	Pakistan is deeply concerned about the report's conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated as a sequel to the Libyan crisis.
2003/s/pv_4770/151:2	In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into a kind of joint Government, as well as any interference with the powers reserved for the Special Representative.
2010/s/pv_6276/298:4	We know that civil society organisations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.
2007/s/pv_5693/61:2	It is clear that all law and order institutions face serious challenges.
2003/s/pv_4770/65:1	Political pressure on UNMIK has increased significantly, and attempts have been made to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.
2008/s/pv_5855/253:5	Today we have no doubt that the real intention was to prevent the details of his vandalism while acting under the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.
2009/s/pv_6236/97:1	The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report that relate, inter alia, to human rights and the situation of children and women.
2003/s/pv_4770/176:3	We are seriously concerned about this decree, which can have far-reaching consequences.
2011/s/pv_6618/237:4	However, we believe that abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in view of the fact that the conditions for long-awaited large-scale investment and sustainable development do not exist.
2008/s/pv_5930/333:1	At the outset, I would like to express our deep concern about the security situation in the country.
2012/s/pv_6734/105:1	I must say that the subject you have set for our debate today, although exciting, is a great challenge.
2004/s/pv_5025/185:3	As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634), this is a truly daunting challenge.
2003/s/pv_4770/162:1	My delegation regrets, however, that the security situation remains a matter of concern.
2008/s/pv_6049/67:3	I urge Hamas to respond positively to these calls.
2011/s/pv_6609/114:2	He strongly reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, saying that it conveyed a very undesirable and damaging message before the 2012 elections, which could contradict and undermine national achievements in changing the country's image and in establishing and consolidating peace, which was achieved with so much effort with the help of our development partners and the international community.
2004/s/pv_5049/93:1	Unfortunately, the current Palestinian leaders have shown that they are as incapable of being partners in peace as they are of offering their people reform and democratic governance.
2012/s/pv_6735/163:1	First, security concerns remain paramount.
2009/s/pv_6230/101:6	It is clear that the situation in Darfur does not qualify for the implementation of these provisions.
2011/s/pv_6609/86:1	First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is impeding data sharing and early warning.
2007/s/pv_5693/125:6	France strongly condemns this attack and calls upon all parties to exercise the utmost restraint.
2011/s/pv_6495/53:5	The political debate is likely to intensify, as several elections-related appeals have already been submitted to the courts.
2012/s/pv_6709/120:1	The report confirms a worrying picture of the situation in the Sahel region and related security, economic and humanitarian issues.
2005/s/pv_5188/335:1	Secondly, he expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- runs the risk of being overcome in a vote, I would say that I believe that the most important aspect of democracy is indeed the possibility of participation, of exercising the rights of a democracy and voting.
2008/s/pv_6049/308:1	We have expressed our serious concern about the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
2012/s/pv_6734/44:3	In Egypt, we continue to call for a peaceful and immediate transfer of power to a civilian Government.
2005/s/pv_5188/144:3	The situation of minorities remained a matter of concern, especially with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.
2004/s/pv_5049/219:1	Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli.
2012/s/pv_6729/134:1	There is another challenge that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority: the creation of a local and regional administration in the liberated regions of Al-Shabaab.
2005/s/pv_5243/35:1	Letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2005/436)
2010/s/pv_6353/207:2	We urge all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any actions or pronouncements that might incite further violence.
2011/s/pv_6618/181:4	The United States calls on the Haitian authorities to fulfil their commitment to fill the six Supreme Court vacancies by 3 October 2011.
2011/s/pv_6618/120:1	We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections is at risk of fading because of the lack of progress in the formation of the Government.
2011/s/pv_6618/139:2	The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.
2004/s/pv_5077/65:1	However, there is still potential for a total collapse of public order, in addition to a collapse of the fragile economy and a disintegration of autonomous institutions.
2012/s/pv_6709/128:4	The negative effects of the situation in Libya will continue to increase, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region, and China expresses its deep concern in this regard.
2011/s/pv_6495/73:1	It remains a matter of great concern to me that the efforts of Liberians to rebuild their court system will take a long time, so that the system itself is likely to remain fragile and easy to penetrate in the short term.
2004/s/pv_5077/78:6	In 1993, that vision was blurred, to say the least, and at that time it was impossible to define the final objectives that would approach the concerns of both peoples.
2010/s/pv_6276/255:1	We have taken note of the caution of the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, and especially with regard to PNTL.
2011/s/pv_6688/74:2	These false accusations contradict the basic reason and standards of a professional attitude, and I am sure that the Council will reject them.
2011/s/pv_6609/96:1	There is considerable interest in the implementation of the joint communiqué of 2 April 2009, referred to in the report.
2010/s/pv_6297/62:2	This has led to high tensions with local communities, as well as threats against MONUC by former CNDP military commanders now integrated into FARDC.
2010/s/pv_6353/140:2	We believe that it is unacceptable for us to deviate from that principle as the fragile situation in the province could be plunged into widespread destabilization.
2011/s/pv_6618/61:2	The voices of Haitian political leaders and civil society actors continue to rise, calling for a national consensus to be reached to move forward in key areas such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.
2004/s/pv_5049/216:1	The Government of Jordan stresses the need for the Government of Israel to stop immediately and completely the acts of violence and destruction it is carrying out in the Gaza Strip, as well as throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory; to put an end to its policy of deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and housing; and to cease immediately its extrajudicial killings and the imposition of collective punishments and other practices against the Palestinian people.
2008/s/pv_5855/153:5	However, we remain concerned that too much emphasis is placed on visits to developing countries.
2004/s/pv_5025/320:2	As UNAMA, we would be irresponsible if we did not urge the international community, the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan and international forces to end this situation, especially on the southern border.
2006/s/pv_5492/55:3	While Hizbollah's actions are deplorable and, as I have already said, Israel has the right to self-defence, the excessive use of force must be condemned.
2008/s/pv_5930/108:1	The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited enormous political, economic and security problems.
2004/s/pv_5025/234:4	Sustained developments in that direction would jeopardize efforts to restore and rebuild the country and, in the long term, threaten peace and stability throughout the region.
2004/s/pv_5025/171:5	We have fenced a 25-kilometre stretch of border and installed searchlights and video cameras at the border crossings.
2011/s/pv_6656/45:2	As members of the Council are aware, migration from North to South has begun and, for the first time, will represent the crossing of an international border.
2008/s/pv_6049/67:4	To call into question the fundamental cornerstones of Palestinian legitimacy and national aspirations cannot be in the interest of the Palestinian people.
2011/s/pv_6662/61:1	The situation in Syria is a source of deep and growing concern for the United Nations.
2004/s/pv_5024/173:2	We are particularly concerned about the lack of training of middle-level civil servants and the serious shortcomings that still remain in the judicial sphere.
2004/s/pv_5024/98:1	While outside the mandate of UNMISET, the recent decision of an Indonesian Court of Appeal to overturn four convictions handed down by the Indonesian Special Human Rights Court directly affects the broader issue of responsibilities.
2009/s/pv_6236/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 10.55 a.m.
2011/s/pv_6618/58:1	I am particularly concerned about the present unstable situation that could deteriorate further if the political situation does not change and if the socio-economic situation continues to be unmet.
2008/s/pv_6049/285:3	The United States must desist from this deliberate disregard, a practice that it has maintained for almost seven years and has led to the deterioration of the situation in the region.
2011/s/pv_6495/48:5	However, they were not important enough to undermine the process. Simple logistics will make it difficult to get the vote twice on election day.
2007/s/pv_5693/198:3	We are also concerned about the situation faced by those who are now involved in the reconstruction of the country.
2009/s/pv_6230/112:2	We are very concerned about the stubborn refusal of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement to participate in the talks.
2011/s/pv_6544/46:2	The Council condemns any unilateral action aimed at creating situations on the ground that adversely affect the outcome of the negotiations.
2011/s/pv_6544/41:3	The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who ordered such acts, shall be held accountable.
2004/s/pv_4934/114:4	Affirmations such as that Palestinians do not love their children or that Palestinians send their children to death because they hate Israel are words full of racism that reflect a kind of attitude that must be flatly rejected, which I am now trying to do.
2004/s/pv_5025/176:4	Blaming others, looking for scapegoats to hold them accountable for failures in Afghanistan and asking those who are already doing more than they should do even more is unfair and unacceptable and will ultimately be counterproductive.
2004/s/pv_4934/108:2	We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and we will be satisfied with regular convictions.
2010/s/pv_6276/91:4	Many achievements have been made, but many challenges remain.
2004/s/pv_5025/124:5	The recent publication by the Council of Ulemas of a religious decree condemning drug trafficking and other related activities can be instrumental in discouraging opium poppy cultivation.
2011/s/pv_6618/286:3	We therefore encourage the members of the Council and also of the Group of Friends to look favourably at these recommendations of the Secretary-General.
2012/s/pv_6734/113:4	It seems that the population not only aspires but demands that more plural and representative governments generate tangible benefits for citizenship.
2010/s/pv_6276/122:1	Timor-Leste continues to face major challenges related to poverty reduction and job creation, particularly for young people.
2009/s/pv_6230/152:3	In the light of recent experiences, it is also clear that the Court will continue to face some serious problems.
2009/s/pv_6236/59:1	Another election-related challenge is the significant number of potential voters who cannot afford the administrative costs of obtaining a national identity card.
2011/s/pv_6544/47:2	The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan withdraw immediately from the Abyei Area.
2010/s/pv_6276/126:1	Security sector reform remains a major challenge for long-term peace and stability.
2009/s/pv_6230/174:1	Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only deterrent against the crimes of greatest concern to the international community.
2004/s/pv_5049/153:3	We are deeply concerned that unless both sides demonstrate a firm will to end terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.
2008/s/pv_6024/135:1	We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
2012/s/pv_6734/269:1	Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuing illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.
2011/s/pv_6618/201:3	We were therefore frustrated that the Secretary-General's report recommended only a partial reduction in reinforcement troops.
2008/s/pv_5930/215:3	Now, however, what Afghanistan has accomplished is considerably undermined by serious challenges to its security and stability.
2012/s/pv_6729/111:1	While air piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a serious problem, we ask the international community not to forget that the solution must be found on land rather than at sea. The comprehensive resolution of the Somali conflict must address all the causes of piracy and other problems, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic wastes.
2008/s/pv_6049/148:1	The second point I would like to address today is our continued concern for the well-being of innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.
2008/s/pv_5930/364:5	Finally, Afghans urgently need to take the lead in the fight against drugs.
2006/s/pv_5492/53:3	I also condemn Hizbollah's reckless disregard for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the region in general.
2007/s/pv_5798/43:1	“The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Algiers on 11 December 2007 in the vicinity of the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, which have caused numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep regret and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, as well as to the people and Government of Algeria.
2004/s/pv_5049/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 4.05 p.m.
2004/s/pv_5077/71:1	I also recall how unpopular it was to speak to Israelis about the 1967 borders, and it was for a long time almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements.
2008/s/pv_6049/155:1	The latest report of the Secretary-General on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expresses the importance of the disarmament of Hizbollah and the end of arms smuggling on the Lebanese-Syrian borders.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/228:2	Needless to say, there are currently no patterns of sexual violence in Kenya, and none of the reported activities related to our country occurred during the reporting period from 2010 to 2011.
2002/s/pv_4597/4:1	“At its 4597th meeting, held in private on 8 August 2002, the Security Council considered the item entitled `The situation concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo'.
2008/s/pv_5930/109:1	I have condemned the terrorist attack against the Indian Embassy in Kabul.
2008/s/pv_5930/260:2	We are concerned about the increase in the insurgency in some areas of Afghanistan.
2006/s/pv_5603/116:2	Indeed, more than half of the African issues of interest to the Council on its agenda relate to the countries of the Great Lakes region: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, northern Uganda, the Sudan and the Central African Republic.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/361:1	Today's debate is about an urgent matter.
2010/s/pv_6276/200:3	It is essential that cases of domestic violence and sexual assault are formally prosecuted in accordance with the penal code.
2008/s/pv_5855/188:5	That is perhaps the result of the urgency and also of the very limitations of this Council, as an intergovernmental political body of a fundamentally executive nature.
2004/s/pv_5049/245:2	It demands that Israel, the occupying Power, abide by all the rules of international law and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law, in addition to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.
2009/s/pv_6230/133:2	This basic obligation is breached by some States without any consequences for their anti-legal conduct.
2007/s/pv_5683/70:2	I hoped that today the new Special Coordinator could accompany us, but the Secretary-General sent him urgently to the region.
2008/s/pv_6024/180:2	On several occasions, our country has expressed its concern about the civilian population in that area and the importance of MONUC deploying there to protect it.
2010/s/pv_6353/139:1	The incident in North Mitrovica clearly demonstrated that, despite the Security Council's mandate on the reconfiguration of UNMIK, EULEX is increasingly moving away from the principle of status neutrality, which is detrimental to the position of the international presence.
2001/s/ac_26/2001/28/412:1	152 dinars per capita x 837 workers x 7 months/17 months = KWD 52,387.
