2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We are facing these problems in a democratic and effective way.
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is obvious that the continued assistance of the international community will be needed and that, as the Secretary-General points out in his report,

2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	Mr. President, We are disappointed that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn this heinous terrorist attack.
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	However, despite these advances, some challenges to the Government's authority and its effective control over the national territory still persist.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also indisputable that, as the occupying Power, Armenia bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.

2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council, which by no means turns out to be true, which ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and which fails to recognize the enormous difficulties that Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimizing the damage to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for Palestinian lives as they do for Israelis.
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel claims compel it to continue these flights, in particular alleged violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).

2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	The lack of land and employment and insecurity prevent many of the people who return to settle in their communities of origin.

2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	This month Prime Minister Fayyad distributed a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008-2010.
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This unpleasant political incident was strongly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma and in numerous press releases subsequently issued by other political interest groups, including the APC and PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Commission for the Registration of Political Parties and the Campaign for Good Government.
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could continue mentioning the widespread poverty, the problems of natural resource management, the thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which we must add thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, the weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict.
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In that sense, we believe that destructive measures, whose purpose is to obtain unilateral political benefits, should be categorically condemned.
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident.
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that makes a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo that is acceptable to the parties difficult.
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from unilateral measures in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine confidence.
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, endangers the very foundations of the principles and values ​​that we are trying to instill in the new institutions that have been established there and make our efforts may result. useless.

2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to humanitarian difficulties, the situation raises security problems.
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any type of value judgment on the substance of the issue; It is a determined invitation to give justice and the political process a chance.
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	The task is doable, however, as long as we set principled but realistic goals and move toward them with deliberate steps, as long as we are not alone in taking those steps.
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	In order to make the most of the time at our disposal and to allow as many delegations as possible to speak, I will not invite speakers one by one to take a seat at the table or to return to the seats reserved for them. one side of the Hall.
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	Failure to comply with its Charter obligations should have consequences for any Member State, and the Sudan should be no exception.

2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge comparable to that of a marathon runner, since the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20, which must then be adopted by May 22.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents communities emerging from conflict from recovering sustainably.
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must clearly state that such behavior is unacceptable.
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	To date Pristina has rejected any initiative in this regard.
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In that sense, the measures taken to address serious problems in the prison system are encouraging, despite the serious problems that still remain.
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity.
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring confirms the warning of history that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure.
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made - and there is no doubt that there has been progress - must be examined in the context of the challenges that Kosovo has faced.
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency situation that, in turn, threatens the peace and stability of Haiti.
