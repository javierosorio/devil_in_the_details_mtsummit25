2012/s/pv_6729/122:2	Monitoring and identification of arms embargo violations should be intensified and targeted sanctions imposed, if necessary, in order to reduce the devastating effects this dynamic can have in the Somali context.
2010/s/pv_6276/298:3	Timor-Leste has taken important steps to address this difficult legacy, but considerable and urgent challenges remain.
2010/s/pv_6259/66:4	The protection of civilians is a long-ignored obligation in Somalia.
2012/s/pv_6729/64:3	The secessionist group of MPs rejected Garowe's process and passed a motion to bring forward the presidential elections from July to April 30 this year.
2008/s/pv_6049/73:1	The general problem is to ensure that the gradual measures that have been implemented are intensified and multiplied and become transforming elements.
2008/s/pv_6049/134:1	First of all, let me emphasize the importance of taking as a basis the current negotiations, both the Israeli-Palestinian track and the Israeli-Syrian track.
2008/s/pv_6049/239:5	However, it is inadmissible to attempt to justify, based on a valid security concern, measures that indiscriminately affect an entire people, in contravention of international humanitarian law.
2011/s/pv_6618/252:3	However, we are concerned that key decision making is so far being undermined by a lack of political consensus.
2012/s/pv_6709/188:3	Although the region's leaders took bold steps to combat this scourge, the Libyan crisis aggravated the situation.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:3	This gender perspective must be present in the reform and training of all security forces.
2012/s/pv_6735/117:1	We note with concern that the area of security continues to be problematic.
2012/s/pv_6735/158:1	The first issue is the narcotics situation in Afghanistan, a serious and growing challenge not only for Afghanistan but also for the rest of the world.
2004/s/pv_5025/182:2	We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms in these areas.
2006/s/pv_5597/80:2	In that context, we reiterate what we state over and over again that the main threat to the investigation is that some parties in our region and elsewhere are taking advantage of it to politicize conclusions that are completely unrelated to the investigation and not based on solid evidence.
2012/s/pv_6735/212:1	However, the security situation remains of real concern to all, despite a decrease in security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the two-month period covered by last year's report.

2004/s/pv_5049/256:1	South Africa has always been among those States that condemn all acts of violence, terrorism, excessive and indiscriminate use of force and physical destruction of property.

2012/s/pv_6709/168:3	The mission's recommendations in this regard require careful consideration.

2005/s/pv_5188/177:5	Local government reform programs should not wait for final status negotiations to begin.
2004/s/pv_5025/51:8	Elections held after a protracted conflict seek to create political legitimacy for the post-war order.
2004/s/pv_4934/49:3	However, as I said at Tuesday's public meeting, facts have to be seen in context, and the Security Council does nothing to contribute to a peaceful solution when it condemns the actions of one side and turns a blind eye to everything else going on in the region.
2010/s/pv_6276/65:1	Perhaps the main long-term challenges for Timor-Leste will be socioeconomic.
2004/s/pv_5049/272:3	At the same time, Cuba expresses its condemnation of the suicide bombings and other acts directed against Israeli civilians, innocent victims of the spiral of violence caused by the policy of its Government, while opposing the manipulation of such isolated acts to question the exercise of legitimate self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify actions, both selective and large-scale, against the Palestinian population.
2005/s/pv_5188/297:1	First, it is important to take into account two equally legitimate desires: on the one hand, the demand of minorities to live in security, to have equal opportunities for economic development and equal access to social services and education, and to exercise the right of return; on the other hand, the desire of the majority of the population to exercise their right to self-determination.
2007/s/pv_5693/59:1	Few Iraqi families have been spared the direct and indirect consequences of violence and human rights violations. It is natural that many of them feel deeply that they are victims.
1999/s/pv_3969/43:1	The Security Council notes with deep concern the humanitarian consequences of the conflict on the people of Angola.
2004/s/pv_5049/82:3	This Council must not allow that, by considering the response to terrorism rather than terrorism itself, that strategy to be rewarded. Terrorism must be rejected, not appeased.
2011/s/pv_6544/51:2	In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms the threats and intimidation to which UNMIS elements are continually subjected.
2012/s/pv_6729/332:1	At the outset, I would like to reiterate that the European Union is deeply concerned about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of its conflict.
2006/s/pv_5603/250:1	In terms of implementation challenges, we believe that sustainable development cannot be achieved without institutions based on good governance and the necessary resources, which will only be available when security and stability prevail.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/100:1	One of the key issues in post-conflict countries is security sector reform.
2010/s/pv_6353/214:5	They do not recognize the illegal and unilateral attempt of secession by the Albanian citizens of Kosovo.
2012/s/pv_6729/340:2	However, concern remains for the 2.3 million people who continue to be in a crisis situation.
2012/s/pv_6735/130:1	However, we are concerned about recent developments that reveal increased tensions between local community members and ISAF contingents.
2012/s/pv_6709/225:2	However, the situation is still worrying, as the long borders that separate us are difficult to control.
2005/s/pv_5243/46:1	I wish to draw the attention of members to document S/2005/436, which contains the text of a letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo addressed to the President of the Security Council.
2011/s/pv_6495/48:2	The exercise went well, with no major security incidents or logistical challenges that could not be overcome.
2007/s/pv_5683/62:1	The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon have expressed concern over the incidents and have disassociated themselves from Fatah al-Islam.
2004/s/pv_5049/256:4	The Council must demand an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from Gaza.
2011/s/pv_6609/86:2	The limited capacity in the region to trace financial flows is another major challenge, especially given the risk that illicit profits could exacerbate corruption.
2010/s/pv_6353/75:4	However, let us be frank with each other: there is no outstanding issue in Kosovo that does not have to do with status, either directly or indirectly.
2004/s/pv_5049/91:2	By contemplating initiatives that, in effect, reward this strategy, the Council would only embolden the extremists and undermine the letter and spirit of the roadmap.
2008/s/pv_5930/63:2	There can be no doubt that we have underestimated the humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan, and Mr. John Holmes will address the subject in more detail.
2009/s/pv_6230/56:4	He has refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun.
2005/s/pv_5188/54:3	In those difficult days and weeks, the political leaders and citizens of Kosovo faced a very unusual situation with maturity and without any disorder or instability.
2008/s/pv_5930/290:1	In addition, we have better defined our initiatives to be even more effective in Afghanistan and specifically in Kandahar province.
2012/s/pv_6734/129:3	At the United Nations Security Council, three cases, in particular, are calling for our attention today.
2004/s/pv_5077/88:6	The one-state solution might satisfy several fundamental Palestinian desires but it does not meet Israel's essential requirement of retaining its self-determination and sovereignty.
2012/s/pv_6709/102:1	This situation persists even when the Libyan authorities are unable to fully control the situation in their country or prevent weapons from falling into the hands of terrorist elements.
2004/s/pv_5049/118:2	The Palestinians must stop the public incitement to violence and do everything possible to prevent militants from attacking Israel, thus provoking a reaction.
2004/s/pv_5025/60:1	We have reason to be confident that these groups will not succeed in undermining the electoral process at the national level.
2008/s/pv_5930/71:2	I was in Afghanistan for four days at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, due to growing concerns about the seriousness of humanitarian and civilian protection issues.
2004/s/pv_5077/56:1	Palestinians feel the struggle as a daily battle of resistance for their identity and against the erosion of the likelihood of a future as a people.
2007/s/pv_5693/127:1	The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian point of view. The Secretary-General confirms that Iraq is experiencing a huge crisis and says that the situation continues to deteriorate.
2004/s/pv_5024/66:6	Although basic training for the Police Reserve Unit was completed on August 23, it is estimated that at least another three months of intensive training and supervision will be required for the duration of its service.
2004/s/pv_4934/72:1	At the same time, Germany and the European Union have previously repeatedly condemned the terrorist atrocities that have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.
2009/s/pv_6101__resumption_1_/87:3	Effective and sustainable democratic governance is an objective that must be pursued with the utmost determination and even a sense of urgency anywhere, and Haiti is no exception.
2004/s/pv_5024/73:4	Undoubtedly, the structure and development of public administration still present important needs in Timor-Leste that need to be considered.
2008/s/pv_6049/273:3	That makes the irresponsible and threatening rhetoric of the Iranian leadership all the more alarming.
2011/s/pv_6495/53:4	It must maintain its independence and objectivity to instill confidence in the electoral process.
2004/s/pv_5077/61:1	Israel is obligated under international law and as the occupying Power to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, as well as to safeguard civilian property.
2012/s/pv_6735/63:2	To improve the situation, it is necessary to enforce the law -- especially the law on the elimination of violence against women -- which criminalizes and penalizes practices that are violent and result in harm to women and girls.
2008/s/pv_6049/65:1	Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the establishment of Hamas, Hamas leader Haniyeh made President Abbas' tenure in office conditional on the resolution of the internal division.
2008/s/pv_5930/337:1	In discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, recent events highlight a bleak picture of the security situation.
2004/s/pv_5049/224:4	In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
2003/s/pv_4770/183:1	Although a senior PISG official in Kosovo and Metohija recently tried to explain the failure with citations of high unemployment rates, the facts point in another direction.
2010/s/pv_6276/312:2	Therefore, another decisive challenge in the near future will be to create a sustainable economy promoted by a culture of democratic and transparent governance, which creates jobs and helps to fulfill the basic social functions of the State.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/426:1	We consider Armenia's position to be a clear challenge to the conflict resolution process and a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.
2012/s/pv_6709/191:1	In the view of the Togolese delegation, all these problems require prompt action to prevent the Sahel region from plunging into widespread insecurity, which would be highly detrimental to its development.
2003/s/pv_4770/111:1	The other crucial elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by improving the efficiency, fairness and overall functioning of the judicial system, and improving law enforcement institutions to curb organized crime and ethnic violence and bring all criminals to justice.
2004/s/pv_4934/98:2	This calls for a clear position, especially, in all honesty, on the part of the United States of America.
2008/s/pv_5930/108:2	We are facing these problems in a democratic and effective manner.
2004/s/pv_5024/265:3	It is obvious that the continued assistance of the international community will be needed and that, as the Secretary General points out in his report,
2011/s/pv_6548/50:1	At the same time, President Al-Bashir is threatening the international community with retaliation and even more crimes.
2004/s/pv_5049/117:1	In the current extremely difficult situation, we urge both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent the conflict from escalating and to start fulfilling their obligations under the roadmap to revive the prospects for peace.
2008/s/pv_5855/188:8	We now know better the depth of challenges we only imagined then.
2011/s/pv_6688/52:2	If these issues are resolved in favor of the prosecution, the accused persons will be found guilty of the charges against them.
2011/s/pv_6609/115:2	He added that it can undermine the peace, security and stability of the state.
2012/s/pv_6735/212:2	Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to recognize that approximately 50% of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to Afghan security forces.
2007/s/pv_5693/211:1	The humanitarian consequences of the continuing violence in Iraq are of great concern to my delegation.
2005/s/pv_5188/145:2	Minorities, especially the Serb minority, have a fundamental obligation to participate fully in the search for solutions, taking every opportunity to participate in Kosovo's institutions.
2004/s/pv_5049/229:3	It is high time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and to help end the vicious cycle of violence caused by Israel's persistent and continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.
2012/s/pv_6729/326:1	Brazil is also convinced that in order to achieve a stable Somalia, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive strategy that combines security and development.
2004/s/pv_5025/110:2	All this requires an extremely determined fight against entrenched non-state actors, whose existence represents a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of the sovereignty of the Afghan state.
2008/s/pv_5855/333:7	Mr. Chairman: We are disappointed that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn this heinous terrorist attack.
2012/s/pv_6729/174:4	However, despite these advances, some challenges to the Government's authority and effective control over the national territory still persist.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/408:3	It is also undisputed that, as the occupying Power, Armenia bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.
2005/s/pv_5188/295:1	In order to achieve more concrete progress, the international community must act in a more concerted and decisive manner to establish the basic framework.
2012/s/pv_6729/64:1	Another current challenge is the political stalemate in the Transitional Federal Parliament.
2010/s/pv_6276/171:2	In this context, we remain concerned about Timor-Leste's most vulnerable citizens: the poor and the displaced.
2004/s/pv_5049/84:4	It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council, which, however repeated, proves to be true, that ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights and fails to recognize the enormous difficulties Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for Palestinian lives as for those of Israelis.
2007/s/pv_5788/68:3	We note the security concerns that Israel claims compel it to continue these flights, particularly the alleged violations of the arms embargo established under resolution 1701 (2006).
2008/s/pv_6049/229:4	Today I will emphasize only the following four aspects.
2008/s/pv_5930/74:5	Lack of land and employment and insecurity prevent many returnees from settling in their home communities.
2003/s/pv_4770/154:2	The Government of Germany strongly condemns these acts of violence.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/404:1	Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I apologize for asking for the floor once again. We believe that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to pass over in silence the remarks made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to confuse the Council.
2004/s/pv_5049/239:1	The continued hardship and suffering of the Palestinian people continues to be a tragic representation of the consequences of not implementing resolutions and not enforcing Security Council decisions.
2008/s/pv_5919/36:1	The meeting was called to order at 6:10 p.m.
2007/s/pv_5788/54:2	This month Prime Minister Fayyad distributed a summary of the Palestinian reform and development plan for 2008-2010.
2011/s/pv_6609/112:2	This unpleasant political incident was strongly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma and in numerous press releases issued subsequently by other political interest groups, including the APC and PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Commission for the Registration of Political Parties and the Campaign for Good Governance.
2006/s/pv_5603/152:4	We could go on mentioning widespread poverty, natural resource management problems, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which must be added thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict.
2003/s/pv_4770/89:2	In this sense, we believe that destructive measures aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be categorically condemned.
2010/s/pv_6353/91:1	While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident.
2010/s/pv_6353/161:3	We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that would hinder a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo, acceptable to the parties.
2008/s/pv_6049/75:3	Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine trust.
2003/s/pv_4770/205:2	Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, jeopardize the very foundations of the principles and values we are trying to instill in the new institutions that have been formed there and render our efforts may prove futile.
2010/s/pv_6259/58:5	As a result, the boundaries of security threats in many countries within and outside Africa, including members of this Council, have been overstepped, exposing their vulnerabilities.
2011/s/pv_6495/59:1	In addition to humanitarian difficulties, the situation raises security concerns.
2009/s/pv_6230/201:2	As we have always stressed, this position does not imply any kind of value judgment on the merits of the issue; it is a resolute invitation to give justice and the political process a chance.
2004/s/pv_4952/90:4	However, the task is achievable, provided that we set principled but realistic objectives and move towards them with deliberate action, as long as we are not alone in taking those actions.
2004/s/pv_5049/202:1	In order to make the best use of the time available to us and to allow as many delegations as possible to take the floor, I will not invite speakers one by one to take their seats at the table or to reoccupy the seat reserved for them at the side of the room.
2009/s/pv_6230/135:3	Failure to comply with its Charter obligations should have consequences for any Member State, and Sudan should be no exception.
2010/s/pv_6276/105:2	As I have stressed on many occasions, the lasting security and stability of any country, including Timor-Leste, can only be achieved through corresponding socio-economic development.
2012/s/pv_6729/224:2	We believe that Somalia faces a challenge comparable to that of a marathon runner, as the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20, which must then be adopted on May 22.
2012/s/pv_6722__resumption_1_/213:3	The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict communities from recovering in a sustainable manner.
2004/s/pv_5025/282:1	The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that such behavior is unacceptable.
2003/s/pv_4770/187:5	To date, Pristina has rejected any such initiative.
2012/s/pv_6735/108:3	In this regard, the measures taken to address the serious problems in the prison system are encouraging, despite the serious problems that remain.
2010/s/pv_6276/69:2	Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity.
2012/s/pv_6734/72:1	The Arab Spring confirms history's warning that when governments respond with an iron fist to the irrepressible dreams, legitimate demands and invincible hopes of their citizens, they are ultimately doomed to failure.
2005/s/pv_5188/52:2	The progress made - and there is no doubt that there has been progress - must be seen in the context of the challenges Kosovo has faced.
2011/s/pv_6618/250:3	First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency situation which, in turn, threatens the peace and stability of Haiti.
2012/s/pv_6729/259:7	Building an effective Somali judicial capacity will also enable Somalis to combat the scourge of terrorism and piracy.
2008/s/pv_5930/308:2	It is clear that our collective efforts require considerable resources and greater integration, a fact that is reflected in the results of the conferences held in Bucharest and Paris.
2006/s/pv_5465/54:1	For this reason Greece has insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth preambular paragraph, in which the Council urges progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement"", that it should be reiterated that such negotiations have to take place between the two communities.",1,0.99089315533638
2010/s/pv_6259/100:1,"In that regard, we want to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to empower the Somali security forces to control the most violent insurgents and to enable the government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.",1,0.9924323558807373
