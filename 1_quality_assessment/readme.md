This directory contains two main directories, each dedicated to a specific part of the project:

### 1. Quality Evaluation
This directory contains all the resources and scripts related to the quality evaluation of the project. It has its own dedicated README file with detailed instructions on how to use the evaluation tools and interpret the results.

### 2. Translation Folder
The translation directory holds the necessary files and resources for translation tasks. Like the quality evaluation folder, it also includes its own README file that explains how to work with the translation tools and provides step-by-step usage instructions.

Each folder has its own README file to make navigation easier and to keep each section focused on its specific tasks.
