#COMET Evaluation Script

## Overview

This script evaluates translation quality using **COMET** (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation). COMET is a neural-based metric that provides more accurate and context-aware evaluation of machine translation outputs compared to traditional metrics like **BLEU**.

The script dynamically loads input files, processes them using pre-trained COMET models, and saves the evaluation results with corresponding filenames.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the script.

### Installation

```bash
pip install unbabel-comet pandas torch matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
