At the same time, despite the promises that the democratic transition process has entailed, we must not forget that this is a highly responsible stage in the history of the Middle East, which requires maximum vigilance and hard work in order to rule out miscalculations and unpredictability regarding the future of the region.	3
The Security Council expresses deep concern about tensions in the states of Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan.	3
Uganda is concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur.	3
The decision to expel humanitarian workers and silence others with threats of expulsion or attempts to restrict the freedom of movement of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) are part of this reduction policy. the oversight capacity of the international community.	3
In a region as complex as it is vital for the maintenance of international peace and security, authorities face great difficulties and limitations in responding to the demands and expectations of a population eager for reforms.	3
Remarkable progress has been made, but the complex political, economic and security climate continues to present enormous challenges to the elected leaders charged with normalizing our country.	3
Equally worrying are the reports regarding the increase in tensions between the government and opposition parties in the context of issues that are decisive for the future of Kosovo, as well as the persistence of elements willing to resort to violence.	3
The arguments of the representative of Armenia are especially surprising because he has presented them before the Security Council, which, in 1993, approved four resolutions in which it condemned the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories and demanded its immediate withdrawal, full and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian occupation forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan (resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993)).	3
As I said before, the application of double standards in the treatment of terrorism and terrorist groups is also a cause of serious concern that seriously undermines the efforts of the international community in its fight against terrorism.	3
Most people in the region rightly reject a return to the status quo ante, since a truce based on such a limited outcome cannot be expected to last.	3
We cannot fail to express our concern at the worsening security situation in regions that previously enjoyed relative calm.	3
Not so long ago, in May of this year, during a Council debate (see S/PV.6314) on the report of the Secretary-General (S/2010/169) on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK ), we brought to the attention of the international community that the situation in the province was by no means stable and was particularly worrying.	3
Despite having abundant evidence for this, at no time has the United States Government shown its intention to prosecute Posada Carriles for his terrorist actions.	3
Naturally, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, given their geographical proximity to our country.	3
Regional imbalances in overall voter registration rates should be a serious warning in this regard.	3
We condemn the repeated terrorist rocket attacks against Israeli civilian targets.	3
However, we strongly request that greater efforts be made in monitoring information collected from Member States as part of counter-terrorism efforts.	3
Unfortunately, those warnings were not heeded.	3
Finally, we must warn that it is not in the interest of international peace and security for the international community, including the Security Council, to use the plight of the Arab peoples for its own interest and to effect a change of regime.	3
Given the persistence of these complexities and this behavior totally contrary to what is required to achieve a just solution, we must ask ourselves: How can we successfully conclude the peace process in 2009? We believe that the Quartet and the Security Council have a responsibility to devise a practical mechanism to address issues in a situation where one party repeatedly ignores calls and fails to fulfill its obligations, leading us into a cyclical process with no end in sight.	3
The resolution reiterates the importance of meeting these obligations and emphasizes that neither party should undertake any activity that contravenes these obligations or prejudices final status negotiations.	3
We consider the issue of strengthening the legitimacy of the Government to be crucial, since a cause-and-effect relationship has been established between such legitimacy and the elimination of resistance on the part of the informal actors and networks that characterize the nature of power in Afghanistan.	3
We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, because it violates the most fundamental right of human beings: the right to life.	3
The assessment mission report notes that there is increasing concern about the humanitarian and economic effects that the crisis has had on the Sahel region.	3
The unilateral declaration of independence meant a rejection of both from the moment he was born, lifeless.	3
The report mentions a number of developments, particularly in the security sector, which are cause for serious concern.	3
At the same time, it is imperative that all Somali parties, especially the transitional federal institutions, honor their promises to resolve the enormous political, economic and security challenges before them.	3
Viet Nam is deeply concerned about the alarming deterioration of security and humanitarian conditions in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
While we are pleased to note that some 10 million Afghan voters have already been registered, we remain concerned that a sufficient number of voters have not yet been registered in the south and southeast of the country, mainly due to security considerations.	3
We are especially concerned about the very low number of refugee returns, which are the most useful indicators for evaluating the situation in the province.	3
As the representative of Algeria said earlier, the draft resolution, which has not been adopted, contained a clear condemnation of all terrorist attacks committed against civilians, as well as all acts of violence and destruction.	3
To camouflage these events, they sometimes wear military uniforms in order to convey the erroneous perception that the official military component is responsible for this violence.	3
We condemn the disproportionate use of force by the Israeli armed forces in densely populated areas, which has caused great suffering and loss to numerous Palestinian civilians, including children.	3
The Security Council insists that RCD-Goma will be held responsible for any extrajudicial executions, including of members of civil society or people held in the DRC detention centers in Kisangani.	3
These challenges, together, exert political pressure on governments and have direct and dangerous impacts on peace, security and stability in the affected countries.	3
In this sense, I would like to emphasize once again that, unlike other well-known situations that involve unfounded and illegitimate territorial claims, including those that are hidden behind the invented pretext of serving ethnic minority groups, the right to freedom of movement has been recognized. determination and statehood of the Palestinian people.	3
This stalemate causes political tensions and undermines the atmosphere of increasing confidence that prevailed after the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	3
For our part, we consider that the issue of legitimacy is directly related to the holding of the elections, preparations for which are underway in the Joint Electoral Management Body.	3
The Security Council reiterates its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders in particular since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions.	3
The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the widespread destruction caused by the Israeli occupation forces in the northern Gaza Strip, while we demand the immediate end of these attacks and the urgent withdrawal of said occupation forces.	3
The firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza continues, even as we speak; These rockets are deliberately directed against the civilian community, they are aimed at innocent civilians, who are terrorized while they are lying in their beds, sitting in their living rooms or taking their children to school.	3
I also wish to reiterate that the four members of the F-FDTL who were convicted of murder in the shooting that left eight PNTL officers in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and the remaining three received reductions in their sentences, still They have not paid the victims&#39; widows the compensation ordered by the court.	3
Such actions can be considered as indirect participation in deceiving public opinion and disregarding the position of the Government of Syria regarding the events that occurred on its own territory. This is an irresponsible incitement to all kinds of violent acts, providing international cover for international terrorist acts carried out by terrorist groups against Syria, its interests and its people.	3
Let&#39;s be frank: these accounts from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and magnitude of the conflict.	3
Leaders of provisional self-government institutions frequently shirk their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
Among these concerns, one must be highlighted: the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
It is with even greater concern that I must report today that, despite considerable efforts by UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved much.	3
The socioeconomic challenges facing Afghanistan are significant.	3
Its issues include the financing of the electoral campaign, electoral activities and public order, access to the mass media and the misuse of government resources for political purposes.	3
Finally, the broad institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity of several of the societies currently undergoing such historic and profound changes may raise particular tensions and security concerns.	3
A true understanding of the challenges facing each individual country is developing.	3
&quot;Antagonism between political forces overshadows the country&#39;s recent democratic success and threatens its progress toward permanent stability.&quot; (S/2011/540, para. 55)	3
In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
There is concern about the deterioration in the population&#39;s standard of living as a consequence of the difficulties that had to be faced in 2008, particularly due to the global food crisis and the scourge of the hurricanes that devastated the island.	3
However, they also expressed concern that every time there is a sign of hope in the Middle East there is an escalation of violence and destruction.	3
&quot;In particular, I would like to highlight that the Taliban - as your report concludes - continue to be a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and containing them is an essential aspect.&quot;	3
However, the country continues to face challenges in its quest for stability and development, including the security situation, worsening humanitarian situation, challenges in the areas of rule of law and human rights. human rights and the incessant violence that has caused the death of civilians, which continues to increase.	3
Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem, requiring our collective efforts and contribution.	3
The Secretary-General warns unequivocally that none of the eight standards have been fully met so far.	3
We categorically condemn this morning&#39;s ruthless attack on the shrines of Iman Ali al-Hadi and Imam Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the outrage of the Iraqi people at this crime, which is another deliberate attempt by Al-Qaida to sow dissent and confront religious currents in Iraq.	3
This means that secessionists continue to flagrantly ignore international law, thereby rejecting the universal principles of the United Nations Charter.	3
We emphasize the tragic consequences that these messages recently had in other places on the continent.	3
However, make no mistake: my country is also prepared to incessantly resist the unilateral declaration of independence as long as a compromise solution is not in sight.	3
The administrative reform at the national level to date does not represent an improvement.	3
We highlight the issue of violence to express our impatience regarding the urgency of finding satisfactory solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
I am concerned that this vote and this impasse in Parliament could undermine the important achievements that Somali stakeholders and their partners have made.	3
In all of those conversations, I was heartened to find a convergence of views: we were all amazed at the much progress Liberia has made since the fighting ended in 2003, but we all fully realized how daunting the challenges Liberia still faces and that Ultimately, we cannot take anything for granted.	3
Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian Special Court process, additional corrective measures would be necessary to ensure justice is done.	3
It is unacceptable and also contravenes the publicly declared ban on landmines by anti-government forces.	3
In their public statements, Colonel Gaddafi and his relatives have continued to threaten citizens with civil war and the possibility of mass killings if protests continue.	3
The Council condemns all attacks carried out by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, and endanger the peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the attacks against Birao carried out by the Convention of Patriots for the Justice and Peace on July 19 and November 24.	3
The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel&#39;s withdrawal from Lebanon -- which was certified by this Council six years ago -- would result in security along their northern border, find themselves subjected to constant rocket attacks by Hezbollah, that penetrate more into Israeli territory every day.	3
The number of attacks against national and international security forces, officials of public institutions and humanitarian personnel has increased. The number of attacks against polling stations and threats against registration teams has increased.	3
This was made clear by recent incidents of DIS indiscipline, namely the alleged murder of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March.	3
We note that the enduring challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
At the same time, my delegation believes that the elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular the Serbian representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their electorate if they adopted a more participatory attitude, instead of withdrawing from the legislature when faced with difficult situation.	3
We must not underestimate the threat posed in Afghanistan by the destabilizing activities of the Taliban and Al-Qaida.	3
Although neither side appears willing to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalating tensions and destabilization that could lead to full-scale confrontation and endanger civilian lives.	3
Despite everything, the situation inside Kosovo is still worrying.	3
Like other speakers before us and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the act that led to the death of Mr. Dzeković and the injury of others during the protests that took place on 2 July in the North Mitrovica.	3
We urge Israel to end its military incursions into Gaza.	3
South Africa underlines that, given the magnitude of these challenges, there is a need for a comprehensive strategy that incorporates security, humanitarian assistance, good governance and socio-economic development.	3
Recent events in the region confirm the concerns that its interlocutors have systematically conveyed to the mission.	3
These acts are absolutely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must end these attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.	3
During our previous debate, Belgium had shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General about the dangers that violence in Iraq represents for a society, institutions and political process that remain fragile.	3
We urge the Palestinian Authority to do everything possible to end these attacks.	3
The Palestinians and the Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.	3
This is obviously because the States concerned rejected their measures.	3
It is important to give women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, a leading role in maintaining peace and consolidating peace, and it is even more important and urgent to do so in the prevention process. of conflicts.	3
These actions have been undertaken despite the position clearly against them adopted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and in defiance of the provisions of the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
They insist on treating the case as a simple immigration crime.	3
I repeat today what I already said on January 31 (see S/PV.6710): it is unacceptable that the Council is prevented from assuming its responsibilities.	3
All of this occurred despite repeated condemnations of these inhuman acts in Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), resolutions that became beacons of hope for millions of women and girls who were victims. of abuses around the world.	3
The second is to urgently ask once again that the Security Council adopt indispensable measures to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
Faced with this clear situation of threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without the double standards that characterize it on this issue and adopt, urgently and decisively, the draft resolution presented by Algeria on behalf of the countries that make up the Group of Arab States.	3
We are deeply concerned that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one party against the other, despite the fact that the international community and the Security Council have clearly expressed their abhorrence of that situation.	3
We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to implement the obligation contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to prohibit the trade in Somali charcoal, especially by those most active in that trade.	3
This is important to strengthen the Mission&#39;s capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, victims of an obvious humanitarian disaster, as Mr. Doss stressed, and of mass violations of human rights, in particular targeted acts of violence. against women and children.	3
Measures that could weaken confidence or damage the outcome of negotiations must be suspended and reversed.	3
The siege must be lifted immediately so that the civilian population in Gaza can have access, essentially to water, jobs, commerce, medical care and education, in short, access to their basic needs.	3
My delegation is concerned that the security situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate.	3
We must reject any attempt to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
We were prevented from even condemning the violence and approving a peaceful plan drawn up by Syria&#39;s own neighbors.	3
The fact that both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, are employing intense rhetoric is a cause for concern.	3
Egypt once again demands that Israel immediately end its attacks on Gaza.	3
The declaration outlines issues of concern and towards the end contains Somali women&#39;s urgent call for the international community to raise gender issues, including with Somali leaders.	3
We are seriously concerned that the special processes created for this purpose appear to have failed.	3
We have noted with concern that the Secretary-General believes that many of the factors that fueled the 2006 crisis are still present in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, as the Council perhaps realized in my statement this morning.	3
He also emphasizes that Rwanda has the obligation to use its great influence to ensure that RCD-Goma does not carry out any such actions.	3
In compliance with these resolutions, this body must demand that the Government of the United States immediately try Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose justice has been demanding him for years.	3
The Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations must make more efforts in prevention activities, such as the provision of safe water and sanitation.	3
The Security Council expresses serious concern at reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriyas into the town of Abyei and its surroundings, a phenomenon that could force major changes in the ethnic composition of the area.	3
We urge Israel to respect its obligations towards the population of the occupied territories.	3
However, active non-intervention to restore stability in that country already calls into question the effectiveness of the international community and involves enormous amounts of costly resources.	3
We remain concerned that, despite all attempts to restore peace and security, efforts to stabilize the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have recently been hit by major setbacks.	3
Chile also understands that operative paragraph 2 of the failed draft resolution includes a condemnation of suicide attacks that have often affected innocent civilians in Israel.	3
The Republic of South Sudan is extremely concerned about the deterioration of security in the border areas of the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
The Council notes with concern the existing problems in the area of socio-economic development, since the standard of living of the vast majority of Haitians has experienced a marked decline.	3
This is an international obligation that States must comply with to help ensure justice is done for the victims of these painful events.	3
In this context, although the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular are taking the fight against terrorism more seriously, there is little evidence that a truly joint effort is being made to provide a more international response. linked to terrorism.	3
Our main concern in this regard is the fact that, according to the report, none of the eight standards have yet been fully met.	3
&quot;The Security Council notes with concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, scheduled to take place on November 29, 2009, according to the statement dated May 18, 2009 of the Permanent Consultative Framework established by the Political Agreement of Ouagadougou, had been approved by all the main political actors in Côte d&#39;Ivoire.	3
Monitoring and identification of violations of the arms embargo must be intensified, and selective sanctions imposed, if necessary, in order to reduce the devastating effects that this dynamic can have in the Somali context.	3
The protection of civilians is a long-ignored obligation in Somalia.	3
The secessionist group of parliamentarians rejected Garowe&#39;s process and approved a motion to advance the presidential elections from July to April 30 of this year.	3
However, it is inadmissible to attempt to justify, based on a valid security concern, measures that indiscriminately affect an entire people, in violation of international humanitarian law.	3
However, we are concerned that key decision-making is so far being undermined by a lack of political consensus.	3
This gender perspective must be present in the reform and training of all security forces.	3
We note with concern that the security area remains problematic.	3
We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms in these areas.	3
In that context, we reiterate what we have stated time and time again that the main threat to the research is that some parts of our region and elsewhere are taking advantage of it to politicize conclusions that have no relation to the research and that do not They are based on solid evidence.	3
However, the security situation remains of real concern to all, despite a decrease in security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012 compared to the two-month period covered by last year&#39;s report.	3
However, we are concerned about reports that tensions between the ruling party and opposition parties have intensified.	3
However, as I said in Tuesday&#39;s public meeting, the facts must be examined in context, and the Security Council does nothing to contribute to a peaceful solution when it condemns the actions of one of the parties and turns a blind eye to everything else that happens in the region.	3
At the same time, Cuba expresses its condemnation of the suicide bomb attacks and other acts directed against Israeli civilians, innocent victims of the spiral of violence caused by its Government&#39;s policy, while opposing the manipulation of such isolated acts. to question the exercise of self-defense by the Palestinian people, and justify actions, both selective and large-scale, against the Palestinian population.	3
The Security Council notes with deep concern the humanitarian consequences of the conflict on the people of Angola.	3
This Council must not allow this strategy to be rewarded by considering the response to terrorism instead of terrorism itself. Terrorism must be rejected, not appeased.	3
In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms the threats and intimidation to which UNMIS elements are continually subjected.	3
At the outset, I would like to reiterate that the European Union is deeply concerned about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of its conflict.	3
However, concern remains for the 2.3 million people who continue to be in a crisis situation.	3
However, we are concerned by recent developments that reveal increased tensions between members of local communities and International Security Assistance Force contingents.	3
However, the situation remains worrying, since the long borders that separate us are difficult to control.	3
The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon have expressed concern over the incidents and have disassociated themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
The Council must demand an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from that area.	3
By considering initiatives that actually reward this strategy, the Council would only embolden extremists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
He has refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun.	3
Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do everything possible to prevent militants from attacking Israel, thereby provoking a reaction.	3
We have reason to be confident that these groups will not succeed in undermining the electoral process at the national level.	3
I was in Afghanistan for four days at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, due to growing concerns about the seriousness of humanitarian and protection of civilians issues.	3
The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian point of view. The Secretary-General confirms that Iraq is experiencing a huge crisis and says that the situation continues to deteriorate.	3
At the same time, Germany and the European Union have previously repeatedly condemned the terrorist atrocities that have led to the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	3
Without a doubt, the structure and development of public administration still present important needs in Timor-Leste that need to be considered.	3
That makes the irresponsible and threatening rhetoric of the Iranian leadership all the more alarming.	3
Israel is obliged, in accordance with international law and as an occupying Power, to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, as well as to safeguard civilian property.	3
To improve the situation, it is necessary to implement the law -- especially the law on the elimination of violence against women -- that criminalizes and penalizes violent practices that harm women and girls.	3
Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the creation of Hamas, the leader of that organization Haniyeh conditioned President Abbas&#39;s permanence in office on the solution of the internal division.	3
In discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, recent events highlight a gloomy picture regarding the security situation.	3
In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to guarantee full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).	3
We consider that Armenia&#39;s position constitutes a clear challenge to the conflict resolution process and a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.	3
In the opinion of the Togolese delegation, all these problems require prompt action to prevent the Sahel region from falling into widespread insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	3
The other crucial elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the efficiency, impartiality and overall functioning of the judicial system, and improving law enforcement institutions to put curb organized crime and ethnic violence and bring all criminals to justice.	3
This requires a clear position, especially, honestly speaking, on the part of the United States of America.	3
At the same time, President Al-Bashir is threatening the international community with reprisals and even more crimes.	3
In the current extremely difficult situation, we urge both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent the conflict from escalating and to begin fulfilling their obligations under the road map to revive the prospects for peace.	3
Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to recognize that approximately 50% of the Afghan population lives in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
The humanitarian consequences of the continued violence in Iraq are of great concern to my delegation.	3
It is time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and fulfill the most basic rights of the Palestinian people and help end the vicious cycle of violence caused by Israel&#39;s persistent and continued unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.	3
All of this requires an extremely determined fight against entrenched non-state actors, whose existence represents a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of the sovereignty of the Afghan State.	3
Mr. President, We are disappointed that, despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn this heinous terrorist attack.	3
However, despite these advances, some challenges to the Government&#39;s authority and its effective control over the national territory still persist.	3
It is also indisputable that, as the occupying Power, Armenia bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.	3
In that context, we continue to be concerned about the most vulnerable citizens of Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	3
It is part of a mantra constantly repeated before this Council, which by no means turns out to be true, which ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and which fails to recognize the enormous difficulties that Israeli forces face in trying to protect their citizens and minimizing the damage to Palestinian lives when the terrorists they face show as little concern for Palestinian lives as they do for Israelis.	3
We note the security concerns that Israel claims compel it to continue these flights, in particular alleged violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).	3
The lack of land and employment and insecurity prevent many of the people who return to settle in their communities of origin.	3
The German Government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I apologize for asking to speak once again. We believe that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to silently ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to confuse the Council.	3
The continued hardship and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a tragic representation of the consequences of failure to implement resolutions and enforce decisions of the Security Council.	3
This unpleasant political incident was strongly condemned in a press release issued immediately after the incident by the Office of President Ernest Bai Koroma and in numerous press releases subsequently issued by other political interest groups, including the APC and PMDC parties, the Independent Media Commission, the Commission for the Registration of Political Parties and the Campaign for Good Government.	3
We could continue mentioning the widespread poverty, the problems of natural resource management, the thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, to which we must add thousands of ex-combatants waiting to be reintegrated, the weak and unreformed security sectors, massive human rights violations and many other threats that could instigate a new conflict.	3
In that sense, we believe that destructive measures, whose purpose is to obtain unilateral political benefits, should be categorically condemned.	3
While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has blamed the other for provoking the incident.	3
We also wish to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to a situation of instability in the region that makes a peaceful solution to the situation in Kosovo that is acceptable to the parties difficult.	3
Israel must also refrain from unilateral measures in Jerusalem that disrupt the status quo or undermine confidence.	3
Organized crime, deeply rooted in political and social life, together with extremism, endangers the very foundations of the principles and values that we are trying to instill in the new institutions that have been established there and make our efforts may result. useless.	3
As a consequence, the limits of security threats have been crossed in many countries inside and outside Africa, including members of this Council, exposing their vulnerabilities.	3
Failure to comply with its Charter obligations should have consequences for any Member State, and the Sudan should be no exception.	3
We believe that Somalia faces a challenge comparable to that of a marathon runner, since the drafting of the constitution must be completed by April 20, which must then be adopted by May 22.	3
The impunity of these high-ranking officials is unacceptable and prevents communities emerging from a conflict from recovering in a sustainable way.	3
The Afghan authorities and the international community must clearly state that such behavior is unacceptable.	3
To date Pristina has rejected any initiative in this regard.	3
Although the President acted in accordance with his constitutional prerogatives, I expressed concern that the pardon granted on December 25, 2009 could exacerbate perceptions of impunity.	3
First, they have created a permanent humanitarian emergency situation that, in turn, threatens the peace and stability of Haiti.	3
For this reason, Greece has insisted on the need to clarify, in the sixth paragraph of the preamble, in which the Council urges &quot;progress towards the resumption of negotiations to reach a comprehensive solution&quot;, that it should be reiterated that these negotiations have to occur between the two communities.	3
In that sense, we want to go further and say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to control the most violent insurgents and to allow the Government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
In his report, the Secretary-General notes that some progress has been made in most of these areas, except for the essential issue of local government reform and, in particular, decentralization, where the progress, by comparison, is not enough.	3
Some concerns have been expressed about the fairness of registration, most recently raised by several presidential candidates.	3
To continue in this fight, it is necessary for the international community to make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
My delegation firmly condemns these acts of violence and expresses its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
In return, the authorities in Belgrade should end the obstruction tactic that prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo&#39;s public institutions. The &quot;empty chair policy&quot; carries a great risk, the risk that the history of Kosovo will be written without the Kosovo Serbs.	3
We are particularly concerned about the uncontrolled proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
We call on Israel to take further steps to eliminate settler outposts in accordance with the road map and address the growing threat of settler extremism.	3
Indeed, a greater United Nations presence is vital, but for the added value of our Organization to be fully exploited, the necessary means, both in terms of personnel and security, will need to be in place, as Mr. Eide recalled a few minutes ago.	3
Regarding the military aspects of security sector reform, the Government has made clear that it wishes to rely heavily on bilateral aid to increase the capabilities of the military.	3
In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the lack of progress on freedom of movement for minorities, sustainable returns and significant representation of minorities in government structures and the public sector in general.	3
My Government appreciates the numerous expressions of condemnation and indignation that this atrocity has provoked. We are especially grateful for the Security Council&#39;s swift reaction to this gruesome crime.	3
In fact, because there is a history of foreign interference in the region, such recommendations will not only be suspect in the eyes of various segments of society, but may also have the capacity to aggravate the problem.	3
Above all, what worried us most was the insistence of the authorities in Pristina on somehow implementing the so-called strategy for the northern part of Kosovo, in flagrant contravention of resolution 1244 (1999), which is the main legal platform international to resolve the Kosovo issue.	3
In a special way, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation of the levels of socioeconomic development in Haiti and its food security.	3
However, it is worth noting that without a strong justice and security sector, the flourishing peace and stability in the country could be threatened.	3
The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of these acts through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, which enjoys broad and abundant participation.	3
The threat to security and stability in Afghanistan posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in illicit drug trafficking is real and must be constantly addressed.	3
We condemn all acts of terrorism perpetrated in Afghanistan, especially the most recent one that took place at the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the governments and people of the affected countries, as well as to the families of the victims.	3
The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is essential to tailor the Council&#39;s responses, as well as to enhance actions taken to prevent sexual violence.	3
True establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires the formation of an effective and democratic army, judicial system and police force.	3
The international community should -- including through the auspices of the United Nations -- use diplomatic influence and facilitate, among other things, technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice reform; the drafting of new constitutions and legal frameworks; and the promotion of electoral institutions and the holding of elections.	3
It calls for adherence to international law and for the parties to fulfill their obligations and the road map to achieve the vision of two States living side by side in conditions of peace and security.	3
In these conditions, where deep inequalities and political, economic and social exclusion converge, a process of transformation of the prevailing order emerges in search of economic and political changes and alternatives of participation and openness towards new spaces and mechanisms of expression that imply, in short , the vindication of fundamental rights.	3
ISAF troops must fully fulfill their mandate to eradicate threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
In the opinion of my delegation, to prevent new outbreaks of violence and instability in the northern region of Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process is accompanied by policies aimed at guaranteeing the socio-economic stability of the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
Withholding that level of funding would render any government useless, and even more so an authority in occupied territory. If funds are not immediately unlocked, it will jeopardize the achievements of state-building, including greater good governance that would benefit the Palestinian people and the development of security forces that uphold law and order in the West Bank.	3
Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a common concern of all members of the United Nations and the international community at large.	3
However, there is a serious danger that, as a result of this decision, which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin conferences, the country faces an explosive situation characterized by a new armed resistance and the internal division of the power structures. .	3
They have undertaken all these actions, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and use these arguments to continue extorting us and obtain more concessions from us.	3
Banning illegal cross-border movement is vital in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
Unless addressed by the Government, these problems could pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	3
To prevent a new wave of violence, both sides and the international community must act promptly.	3
We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international standards and humanitarian law. We therefore urge the international community, the Quartet and all other stakeholders to intervene immediately and decisively to demand that Israel put an end to such acts, which pose a serious threat to peace and security in the region. from the Middle East. Violence only generates violence. The region will be trapped in a vicious circle from which it will be difficult to escape.	3
In this regard, we are very concerned about the prevailing security situation in Afghanistan, which has been deteriorating since last year as a result of the subversive activities of the remaining Taliban and Al-Qaida elements, the clashes between the leaders and the drug trade.	3
Somali leaders must work toward a political process that is open to all those willing to reject violent opposition.	3
When UNMIK and KFOR requested information about the Army presence in the Kosovo Protection Corps, they received a very typical response from the Corps commander, who said that, given his limited powers, he could not provide any further information.	3
While this is constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties would be expected to present territorial and security proposals within 90 days, remain not taking place.	3
We urge the Government of Haiti to take strong measures to prevent such violence and ensure that those responsible for such acts are brought to justice.	3
The Russian Federation once again calls on the Israeli and Palestinian sides to show restraint and a high level of responsibility, and to refuse unilateralism.	3
I cannot stress enough the risk that the lack of military helicopters entails for the operational effectiveness of the force.	3
Beyond MINURCAT&#39;s area of responsibility in eastern Chad, other developments are also cause for concern.	3
Furthermore, while the overall security situation has remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full security responsibility on 20 May, smuggling, illegal trade and the crossing of borders, as well as the tensions that arose following the demonstrations that took place in Dili in July.	3
The lack of participation in these institutions prevents progress on specific issues of public administration, and does not contribute to improving the international image of Kosovo.	3
Despite our assessment that a complete ceasefire is difficult to achieve at this time, I remain of the view that the international community must make clear its position on the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for Israel to make a much greater and more reliable to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure while the conditions for such a cessation are established as a matter of urgency.	3
On March 4, he urged the issuance of arrest warrants against state officials, provoking popular outrage and weakening hopes for peace and stability.	3
We are also concerned about the resurgence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate appears to be slowly declining.	3
However, in 2007, after the arrest warrants were issued for Harun and Kushayb, President Al-Bashir publicly rejected their application, challenged the authority of the Security Council and declared that Harun had done what he had been ordered to do. .	3
In this context, it reaffirms that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola is the refusal of UNITA to comply with the basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol and reiterates its demand that UNITA abide by its obligations to demilitarize and allow the extension of the administration of the State to the territories it controls.	3
The President strongly described the unfortunate incident as unpleasant and unacceptable as it foreshadows possible violence during the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
The Movement for Democratic Change candidate has little or no access to Zimbabwe&#39;s media; is prohibited from campaigning freely; and there are reports that the State has confiscated campaign buses and vehicles, supposedly because they were not properly registered.	3
Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses concern about the current political stalemate in establishing a new government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	3
We have to admit that we are very concerned about the current situation in Afghanistan.	3
We have turned to the Council on several occasions to urge Israel to end its military attacks, ensure the protection of the civilian population and end the illegal punitive measures that are causing a deliberate human catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.	3
Cuba appears once again before the Security Council to denounce and condemn in the most forceful manner the complicity and absolute responsibility of the Government of the United States with the release of this individual.	3
Africans have clearly expressed their concerns regarding the situation in Zimbabwe.	3
The European Union is deeply concerned about the cycle of vicious violence currently taking place in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
President Al-Bashir retaliated diplomatically against Kenya and threatened economic and trade sanctions.	3
In that context, we consider it important to draw the attention of the Security Council to the serious threats posed by radical and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahir, and to urge the Council to impose the strongest possible sanctions against terrorist organizations.	3
I must report, with great concern, an escalation in criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	3
Furthermore, Israel has regularly continued aerial violations of the Blue Line, in direct violation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).	3
In that sense, we have taken note of the statements issued by the main Kosovar elected representatives, who immediately condemned the crime and called for those responsible to be brought to justice.	3
Consequently, the international community must take whatever measures are necessary to prevent Israel from persisting in the deplorable destructive policy it has undertaken in Gaza, and must emphasize its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which violate international law and international humanitarian law. .	3
This issue has never ceased to concern us.	3
But we are also against extrajudicial executions and we condemn them.	3
We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes in Kosovo.	3
However, we do not believe that sovereignty requires that the Council remain silent when Governments massacre their own populations, threatening regional peace and security in the process.	3
As Prosecutor, I will deal with any judicial challenges of President Al-Bashir and other suspects in court.	3
Azerbaijan&#39;s refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the main impediments to the resolution of the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	3
The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon have issued statements strongly condemning the criminal actions of Fatah al-Islam as attacks on the stability and sovereignty of Lebanon.	3
The United States urges the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble vetting efforts.	3
When the situation in Haiti is discussed within the framework of the United Nations, attention is almost always focused on so-called security issues, and urgent attention to serious structural, economic and social problems is minimized, for all practical purposes. social problems that afflict the country.	3
Regarding the humanitarian situation, we are concerned that, according to information from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 20 million people in the Sahel region need humanitarian assistance, particularly Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
We are also concerned about the very high unemployment rate and the generalization of poverty in the country.	3
However, we are concerned that violence could prevent part of the population from reaching the voting stations in the south and elsewhere.	3
Since the political stalemate began, following the March 29 elections, the Secretary General has expressed his concern about the process and the politically motivated violence.	3
However, in other respects, progress has not met expectations, and many problems remain.	3
My Government considers that they are not only contrary to international law, but also undermine the concept of the rule of law, a fundamental element in the fight against terrorism.	3
We challenge anyone who says there is currently an outbreak of violence or battle anywhere in Sudan.	3
Romania once again emphasizes that any terrorist act is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
The French authorities are extremely concerned about the current worsening of the situation in the northern part of the Gaza Strip last week.	3
We are extremely concerned about this course of action, as it runs the serious risk of undermining the integrity of United Nations operations.	3
This is why we condemn terrorism.	3
The Security Council remains seriously concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic.	3
This is unacceptable and must be strongly rejected, especially by the Security Council, using the mechanisms at its disposal.	3
The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a cause for serious concern.	3
Everyone must reject extremist voices who prefer things to remain as they were and who believe it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations and reach a historic compromise.	3
The situation along the Lebanese-Syrian border also remains a cause for concern.	3
The Security Council also expresses concern about rising tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint.	3
The state of the Blue Nile continues to be a cause of concern for us.	3
Therefore, United Nations bodies engaged in the fight against terrorism should address these fissures more seriously and with greater dedication.	3
In fact, Azerbaijan itself violates these resolutions, which call on the interested parties to undertake negotiations within the framework of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as through various contacts between them.	3
I expressed the deep concern of this Council and the Secretary-General at the recent rise in tensions between the north and the south, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	3
The Russian Federation expresses its deep regret and concern over reports of continued violence in Darfur.	3
I am very concerned about the latest escalation that has occurred between Gaza and Israel.	3
It is clear that these circumstances represent the greatest obstacle to the stability and progress of Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, threaten to undo the progress achieved over the course of almost three years.	3
Promoting security and stability remains a fundamental issue.	3
However, the process has also highlighted how significant the challenges remain in Liberia&#39;s security sector, especially with regard to the logistics, communications and mobility capabilities of the police and immigration service.	3
Pakistan is deeply concerned by the report&#39;s conclusion that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated as a fallout from the Libyan crisis.	3
In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into some kind of joint government, as well as any interference with the powers reserved to the Special Representative.	3
We know that civil society organizations have expressed serious concerns in this regard.	3
It is evident that all institutions in charge of establishing public order face serious challenges.	3
Political pressures on UNMIK have increased significantly, and attempts have been made to question the role conferred upon it by resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
Today we have no doubt that the true intention was to prevent the details of his vandalism from being made public while acting under the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.	3
The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report which refer, among other things, to human rights and the situation of children and women.	3
We are seriously concerned about this decree, which could have very broad consequences.	3
However, we believe that an abrupt withdrawal would be counterproductive and would create an unprecedented vacuum, especially considering the fact that the conditions conducive to the long-awaited large-scale investment and sustainable development do not exist.	3
At the outset, I would like to express our deep concern regarding the security situation in the country.	3
I must say that the topic you have set for our debate today, while exciting, is a great challenge.	3
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634), this is a truly daunting challenge.	3
However, my delegation deplores the fact that security conditions remain worrying.	3
I urge Hamas to respond positively to these calls.	3
He strongly reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, saying that it sent a very undesirable and damaging message ahead of the 2012 elections, which could contradict and spoil national achievements in changing the image of the country and establishing and consolidating peace, which which was so hard-won with the help of our development partners and the international community.	3
Unfortunately, the current Palestinian leaders have demonstrated that they are as incapable of being peacemakers as they are of offering their people reform and democratic government.	3
First, security concerns remain paramount.	3
It is clear that the situation in Darfur does not meet the conditions necessary for the application of these provisions.	3
First, although Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is impeding data sharing and early warning.	3
France strongly condemns this attack and calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint.	3
The political debate is likely to intensify as several election-related appeals have already been filed in court.	3
The report confirms a worrying picture regarding the situation in the Sahel region and related issues of security, economic and humanitarian conditions.	3
Secondly, Mr. Cŏvić expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority -- the Kosovo Serbs -- is at risk of being outvoted. I would say that I consider the most important aspect of the Democracy is really the possibility of participating, exercising the rights of a democracy and voting.	3
We have expressed our serious concern about the suffering of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
In Egypt, we continue to call for a peaceful and immediate transfer of power to a civilian Government.	3
The situation of minorities remains a cause for concern, especially regarding freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians, whether Palestinians or Israelis.	3
There is another challenge that must be addressed as a priority: the creation of a local and regional administration in the regions liberated from Al-Shabaab.	3
We urge all parties to exercise restraint and avoid actions or statements that could incite further violence.	3
The United States calls on the Haitian authorities to fulfill their commitment to fill the six Supreme Court vacancies by October 3, 2011.	3
We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections is at risk of fading due to the lack of progress in forming the Government.	3
The challenges facing the country require Haitian leaders to forge a common bond.	3
However, there remains a possibility of a complete collapse of public order, in addition to a collapse of the fragile economy and a disintegration of autonomous institutions.	3
The negative effects of the situation in Libya will continue to increase, posing a sustained threat to peace and stability in the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
It remains very concerning to me that Liberians&#39; efforts to rebuild their court system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain fragile and easy to penetrate in the short term.	3
In 1993, that vision was blurry, to say the least. At that time it was impossible to define the final objectives that would come close to addressing the concerns of both peoples.	3
We have taken note of the caution of the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission regarding security sector reform, and especially with respect to the PNTL.	3
These false accusations contradict reason and the basic norms of a professional attitude. I am sure that the Council will reject them.	3
The interest in the application of the joint communiqué of April 2, 2009, to which reference is made in the report, is notable.	3
This has caused great tensions with local communities, as well as threats against MONUC by some former CNDP military commanders now integrated into the FARDC.	3
We consider it unacceptable for us to deviate from this principle since the fragile situation in the province could lead to widespread destabilization.	3
Voices of Haitian political leaders and civil society actors continue to be raised calling for a national consensus to be reached to advance in key areas such as national budget issues, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and the constitutional reform.	3
The Government of Jordan emphasizes the need for the Government of Israel to immediately and completely stop its acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip, as well as throughout the occupied Palestinian territory; to end its policy of deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and homes; and to immediately cease its extrajudicial killings and the imposition of collective punishments and other practices against the Palestinian people.	3
However, we remain concerned that too much emphasis is placed on visits to developing countries.	3
As UNAMA we would be irresponsible if we did not call on the international community, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan and international forces to put an end to this situation, especially on the southern border.	3
While Hezbollah&#39;s actions are deplorable and, as I have already said, Israel has the right of self-defense, the excessive use of force must be condemned.	3
The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited enormous political, economic and security problems.	3
The sustained evolution of the situation in this direction would jeopardize efforts to restore and reconstruct the country and, in the long term, threaten peace and stability in the entire region.	3
The situation in Syria is of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
We are particularly concerned about the lack of preparation of mid-level public officials and the major deficiencies that still persist in the judicial field.	3
While outside the mandate of UNMISET, the recent decision by an Indonesian Court of Appeal overturning four convictions by the Indonesian Special Court for Human Rights directly affects the broader issue of assigning responsibility. .	3
I am particularly concerned about the unstable present that could deteriorate further if the political situation does not change and if the socioeconomic situation continues without being properly addressed.	3
The United States must desist from this deliberate disregard, a practice it has maintained for almost seven years and which has led to the deterioration of the situation in the region.	3
Likewise, we are also concerned about the situation faced by those who today collaborate in the reconstruction of the country.	3
We are very concerned by the stubborn refusal of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement to participate in the talks.	3
The Council condemns any unilateral action that aims to create situations on the ground that undermine the results of the negotiations.	3
The Council emphasizes that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who ordered such acts, must be held accountable.	3
Statements such as that Palestinians do not love their children or that Palestinians send their children to their deaths because they hate Israel are racially charged words that reflect a kind of attitude that should be rejected outright, which I am now trying to do. .	3
Blaming others, scapegoating others for the failures in Afghanistan, and asking those who are already doing more than they should to do even more is unfair, unacceptable, and will ultimately be counterproductive.	3
We cannot send the message that terrorists will be immune and be satisfied with routine convictions.	3
The recent publication by the Council of Ulema of a religious decree condemning drug trafficking and other related activities may be instrumental in discouraging poppy cultivation.	3
We therefore encourage the members of the Council and also of the Group of Friends to consider favorably these recommendations of the Secretary General.	3
Apparently, the population not only aspires but demands that more plural and representative governments generate tangible benefits for citizens.	3
Timor-Leste continues to face significant challenges related to poverty reduction and the creation of employment opportunities, particularly for young people.	3
The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan immediately withdraw from the Abyei area.	3
Security sector reform remains one of the main challenges for long-term peace and stability.	3
Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only deterrent against the crimes of greatest concern to the international community.	3
We are deeply concerned that unless both sides demonstrate a strong will to end terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	3
We note that, in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continued illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	3
We were therefore frustrated that the Secretary-General&#39;s report recommended only a partial reduction in reinforcement troops.	3
However, what Afghanistan has now achieved is significantly undermined by serious challenges to its security and stability.	3
While air piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a serious problem, we ask the international community not to forget that the solution must be found on land, not at sea. The comprehensive resolution of the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other problems, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
The second aspect I want to address today is our constant concern for the well-being of the innocent people in Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	3
Finally, there is an urgent need for Afghans to take the lead in the fight against narcotics.	3
I also condemn Hezbollah&#39;s reckless disregard for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the region at large.	3
&quot;The Security Council strongly condemns the terrorist attacks that occurred in Algiers on 11 December 2007 in the vicinity of the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, which caused numerous deaths and injuries, and expresses its deep regret and condolences to the victims of this atrocious act of terrorism and their families, as well as the people and Government of Algeria.	3
I also remember how unpopular it was to talk to Israelis about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements.	3
The Secretary-General&#39;s latest report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly states the importance of disarming Hizbollah and ending arms smuggling along the Lebanese-Syrian borders.	3
I have condemned the terrorist attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.	3
We are concerned about the increase in insurgency in some areas of Afghanistan.	3
Today&#39;s debate is about an urgent matter.	3
It is essential that cases of domestic violence and sexual assault are formally prosecuted in accordance with the penal code.	3
This elementary obligation is failed to be fulfilled by some States without them suffering any consequences for their unlawful conduct.	3
On repeated occasions, our country has expressed its concern for the civilian population in that area and the importance of MONUC being deployed there to protect it.	3
The incident in North Mitrovica clearly demonstrated that, despite the Security Council mandate on the reconfiguration of UNMIK, EULEX is increasingly deviating from the principle of status neutrality, which is detrimental to the position of the international presence.	3
