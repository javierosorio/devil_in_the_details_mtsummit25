43. The experts of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) held discussions with the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on programs and activities that could be organized to support the effective implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).	4
(iii) Improved capacity of [national] authorities in [the violence-affected area], including national law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, and the prison system, to provide necessary security to refugees, internally displaced persons, civilians and humanitarian personnel while respecting international human rights standards.	2
Following the above, on May 15, 2012, the President of the Republic issued Executive Decree PCM 014-2012 in the Council of Ministers. Article 1 of that decree stipulates that the official map issued by the Republic of Honduras, with the boundaries designated in the Regional Administration System, shows that the municipalities located on the land border with the Republic of El Salvador, including: Ocoteppe, Sinuapa, and Mercedes in the Department of Ocoteppe; Cololaca, Guarita, San Juan Guarita, Valladolid, Labertod, Mabulaca, Birgenha and Pereira in Lempira Province; San Antonio, Santa Lucia, Magdalena and Colomuncagua in Intibucca Province; Santa Elena, Yarulla, Murcala, CabaÃ±as, Santa Ana, Ubaturo, Mercedes Oriental, and San Antonio North, in the province of La Paz; Caridad, Aramsina, GuascorÃ¡n and Aliansa in the province of Bali.	2
334. The following patterns were noted: First, during attacks on villages, there were deliberate attacks against women and girls, including gang rape. Secondly, women and girls were kidnapped and imprisoned for several days during which they were subjected to repeated rape. Third, rape and other forms of sexual violence continued during flight as well as displacement, including when women left towns and internally displaced persons sites to collect firewood or fetch water.	1
However, the government, as the public authority responsible for policy making, also bears responsibility for dealing with problems of critical importance that arise within or between institutions.	2
Attempts to launder money or finance terrorist acts using new payment methods have already been detected. However, countries are facing difficulties in developing legislation and regulatory systems that are appropriate for these rapidly evolving payment methods.	1
23 - Scope of the arms embargo. The Committee requested the Coordination Group to work towards preparing a document incorporating States' experiences in dealing with the threat of civilian explosives and improvised explosive devices.	2
Although attacks by rebel forces also occurred, the Commission found no evidence that they were widespread or that they regularly targeted the civilian population.	1
3. Recalls that the Committee should refer to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) all requests for listing and de-listing and proposed updates to existing information relating to Section A (âIndividuals associated with the Talibanâ) and Section B (âEntities and other groups and institutions associated with the Taliban movement (`) from the consolidated list, which was before the Committeeâs consideration up to the date of the adoption of this resolution, so that the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) can consider those matters in accordance with resolution 1988 (2011);	2
The request of the Government of Kuwait regarding the claim related to the real estate ownership of a deceased prisoner should not be accepted, given that this matter actually constitutes a request to submit a claim regarding the part related to the real estate ownership after the expiration of the deadline for accepting claims, and that the Secretariat be requested to inform the Government of Kuwait of this.	3
68. Officials' opinions differ on the effectiveness of terrorist training materials available on the Internet, as theoretical guidance, no matter how complete and accurate, requires some degree of practical training or practical experience to help overcome operational obstacles.	2
The parties informed the mission that they were convinced that the Ouagadougou Agreement had ended the armed conflict and that the ongoing political crisis could only be resolved through elections.	4
The reason for this was the charged political atmosphere of this particular period: the judiciary was not widely trusted and criticism was directed at the way the investigation was conducted.	1
22 - There were no reports of the intentional killing of children by armed forces or groups.	2
Desiring to continue to assist Lebanon in searching for the truth and holding the perpetrators of this terrorist act accountable for their crime,	2
At the same time, despite the promises raised by the democratization process, one should not forget that this is a very responsible phase in the history of the Middle East and requires the highest levels of vigilance and painstaking work in order to rule out miscalculations and unpredictability regarding the future of the region. .	3
The Security Council expresses deep concern about the prevailing tension in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.	3
Uganda remains concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur.	3
The decision to expel humanitarian workers and silence others by threats of expulsion, or attempts to restrict the freedom of movement of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, is part of this policy of limiting the international community’s ability to monitor.	3
In a region that is complex and vital for the maintenance of international peace and security, the authorities face great difficulties and constraints when responding to the demands and aspirations of a people eager for reform.	3
Despite the remarkable progress we have made, the complex political, security and economic environment continues to pose significant challenges to the elected leaders charged with normalizing the situation in our country.	3
Equally worrying is information about increasing tension between government and opposition parties on issues critical to the future of Kosovo, as well as the continued emergence of elements willing to resort to violence.	3
The arguments of the Armenian side are surprising, especially since they were mentioned in the Security Council, which in 1993 adopted a series of four resolutions condemning the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territories, and demanding the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian occupation forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan (Resolutions 822) 1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993).	3
As I said previously, the double standards when confronting terrorism and terrorist groups is another important matter of deep concern and seriously undermines what the international community is doing in the collective fight against terrorism.	3
Most people in the region rightly reject a return to the status quo ante, as any truce based on such limited results cannot be expected to last.	3
We can only express concern about the deteriorating security situation in areas that were previously relatively calm.	3
Not long ago in May this year, during the Council's discussion (see S/PV.6314) of the Secretary-General's report on UNMIK (see S/2010/169), we drew the attention of the international community to the fact that the situation The region is far from stable and raises particular concern.	3
Despite extensive evidence to support this, the US government has never shown any intention of prosecuting Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist activities.	3
Naturally, we are deeply concerned about the situation in the states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile given their geographical proximity to our country.	3
The disparities in overall voter registration rates between regions should serve as a serious warning in this regard.	3
We condemn the repeated terrorist rocket attacks on Israeli civilian targets.	3
However, we would like to urge that more efforts be made to follow up on information obtained from Member States as part of the effort to combat terrorism.	3
Unfortunately, these warnings were not heeded.	3
Finally, we must warn that using the plight of the Arab peoples to achieve self-interests and bring about a change in the regime is not in the interest of international peace and security for the international community, including the Security Council.	3
As these complications continue and this behavior is completely at odds with what is required for a just solution, we must ask: How can we bring the peace process to a successful conclusion in 2009? We believe that it is the responsibility of the Quartet and the Security Council to develop a practical mechanism to address these issues, in a situation where one party repeatedly refuses to respond to calls and fulfill its obligations, plunging us into a cyclical process with no end in sight.	3
The resolution reiterates the importance of fulfilling those obligations and stresses that neither party should undertake any activity that conflicts with those obligations under the roadmap or prejudges final status negotiations.	3
We believe that the issue of supporting government legitimacy is important because there is a causal relationship, legitimacy and removing resistance by informal actors and informal networks that characterize the nature of power in Afghanistan.	3
We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as it violates the most basic human right: the right to life.	3
The assessment mission report indicates growing concern about the humanitarian and economic impacts of the crisis on the Sahel region.	3
He rejected both declarations of independence at the moment of his birth.	3
The report mentions a number of incidents, especially in the security sector, that cause serious concern.	3
At the same time, all Somali stakeholders, especially the transitional federal institutions, must act on their promises to address the enormous political, economic and security challenges facing them.	3
Viet Nam is deeply concerned about the alarming deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
While we are pleased that more than 10 million Afghan voters have been registered, we are concerned that there has been insufficient voter registration in the southern and southeastern parts of Afghanistan due to security concerns.	3
We are particularly disappointed by the very low number of returnees, which is the best indicator of the assessment of the situation in the region.	3
As the representative of Algeria pointed out a moment ago, the draft resolution that was not adopted clearly contained a condemnation of all terrorist attacks against civilians in addition to all acts of violence and destruction.	3
Sometimes, in order to cover up these facts, they wear military uniforms to send false messages that the official armed forces are the ones practicing this violence.	3
We condemn the excessive use of force by the Israeli army in densely populated areas, which inflicts widespread suffering and losses on large numbers of Palestinian civilians, including children.	3
“The Security Council affirms that the RCD/Goma faction will be held accountable for any executions carried out outside the judicial system, including among members of civil society or detainees in its detention centers in Kisangani.	3
Together, these challenges constitute political pressure on governments and directly and seriously affect peace, security and stability in the countries concerned.	3
In this regard, I would like to emphasize once again that, unlike some other well-known cases involving illegitimate and unfounded territorial claims, including under the trumped-up pretext of patronage of ethnic minorities, the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination and to establish Country.	3
The impasse could increase political tensions and affect the growing atmosphere of confidence that prevailed following the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	3
For our part, we directly link the issue of legitimacy to the holding of elections, preparations for which are taking place within the framework of the Joint Election Management Authority.	3
“The Security Council reaffirms its condemnation of all assassinations targeting Lebanese leaders, especially those that have occurred since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and their institutions.	3
The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the general destruction caused by the Israeli occupation forces in the northern Gaza Strip. We also demand an immediate end to these attacks and the urgent withdrawal of the occupation forces.	3
At this moment, Qassam rocket fire is still being deliberately directed from Gaza against the civilian population, targeting and terrorizing innocent civilians as they sleep in their bedrooms, sit in their living rooms, or take their children to school.	3
I would also like to reiterate that the four members of the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste convicted of manslaughter in the shooting deaths of eight members of the National Police of Timor-Leste in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom benefited from reduced sentences, They have yet to pay court-ordered compensation to the victims' widows.	3
These positions are considered indirect participation in obscuring the positions of the Syrian government regarding what is happening on its territory, and irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would give international cover for the terrorist acts carried out by armed groups against the interests of the Syrian people and government.	3
Let's be frank: these reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	3
Leaders of the provisional institutions of self-government often evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the constitutional framework.	3
Among these concerns, one concern must be highlighted, which is the deteriorating security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
It is with great concern that I must report to you again today that, despite the great efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved significantly.	3
The social and economic challenges facing Afghanistan are great.	3
These regulations cover campaign finance, electoral activities, public order, access to the media and the misuse of government resources for political purposes.	3
Finally, the widespread institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity in societies currently experiencing profound historical change may give rise to particular tensions and security concerns.	3
A real awareness of the challenges facing each country is emerging.	3
“The rivalry between opposing political forces casts doubt on the country’s recent democratic success and threatens its progress towards lasting stability” (S/2011/540, para. 55).	3
In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
We are concerned about the deterioration of the living standards of the people as a result of the hardships faced by the country in 2008, in particular as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island.	3
But there was also concern because every glimmer of hope in the Middle East was met with escalating violence and destruction.	3
In particular, I would like to stress, as stated in the report, that the Taliban continue to represent a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and that containing that organization is crucial.	3
However, Afghanistan still faces challenges in its quest for stability and development. The main challenges include the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges related to the rule of law and human rights, and continuing violence, leading to increasing civilian casualties.	3
Fourth, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	3
The Secretary-General warns unequivocally that he has not yet fully met any of the eight criteria.	3
We strongly condemn the brutal attack that took place this morning on the shrine of Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan al-Askari in Samarra, and we share the Iraqi people’s feeling of anger over this crime. It is another planned attempt by terrorists to sow the seeds of discord and ignite the flames of sectarian conflict among the people of Iraq.	3
This means that the separatists continue their blatant disregard for international law and rejection of the universal principles of the United Nations Charter.	3
We stressed the recent tragic effects of such messages on other parts of the continent.	3
But there is no mistaking that my country is also prepared to permanently resist a unilateral declaration of independence, as long as there is no settlement in sight.	3
So far there is no improvement in reform management at the national level.	3
We raise the issue of violence in order to express our impatience with regard to finding satisfactory and urgent solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and the stalemate within Parliament could lead to the hard-won gains of the Somali stakeholders and their partners being wasted.	3
In all these discussions, I was heartened to discover a convergence of views: we all marvel at how much Liberia has achieved since the fighting ended in 2003, but everyone is fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that still face Liberia, and that we take nothing for granted. Of him in the end.	3
Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	3
This is unacceptable, and even contradicts the declared ban by anti-government forces on the use of landmines.	3
Colonel Gaddafi and his family members, in their public statements, have continued to threaten citizens with civil war and the possibility of mass massacres if protests continue.	3
The Council condemns all attacks by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, peace and stability in the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the two attacks on Berao by the Rally of Patriots for Justice and Peace on 19 July and 24 November.	3
The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon - approved by this Council six years ago - would bring security along its northern border, found themselves exposed to continuous missile attacks from Hezbollah, which day after day reach deeper into Israeli territory.	3
The number of attacks targeting national and international security forces, employees of public institutions, workers in the humanitarian fields, and representatives of countries has increased. Attacks against polling sites also increased and threats against voter registration teams increased.	3
Recent incidents of indiscipline in the Integrated Security Detachment have made this clear, in particular the allegation that an Integrated Security Detachment commander killed a civilian in Farshana on 22 March.	3
We note that the continuing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
At the same time, my delegation believes that elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, especially Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their constituents if they adopted a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they faced a difficult situation.	3
We should not underestimate the seriousness of the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	3
While neither side appears ready to return to war, there is a worrying pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a large-scale confrontation that could put more civilian lives at risk.	3
However, the situation inside Kosovo today remains a matter of concern to us.	3
Like other speakers who have spoken before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the action that led to the death of Mr. Dzikovic and the injury of several other people during the protests in Mitrovica North on 2 July.	3
We urge Israel to stop its military raids in Gaza.	3
South Africa stresses that, given the scale of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy is required that includes security, humanitarian efforts, good governance, and socio-economic development.	3
Recent developments in the region confirm the concerns long expressed to the Mission by its interlocutors.	3
These actions are completely unacceptable. The Palestinian Authority must put an end to these attacks and prosecute their perpetrators.	3
From our previous discussions, Belgium shared the Secretary-General's concern about the danger that the violence in Iraq poses to a society, institutions and political process that is still fragile.	3
We call on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to stop these attacks.	3
The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees for its security as a state.	3
It is clear that this was due to the aforementioned countries' rejection of his measures.	3
It is important to give women, who are the primary victims of violence in all its manifestations, a major role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and what is even more important and urgent is to do so in the process of conflict prevention.	3
These measures are being taken despite the clear negative position taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and are considered a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
Rather, they insist on treating the case as a secondary immigration crime.	3
I also say today what I said on January 31. (See session S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable to prevent the Council from assuming its responsibilities.	3
This is despite the repeated condemnation of these inhumane acts by Security Council Resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become a source of hope for millions of women and girls victims around the world.	3
The second reason is to once again call on the Security Council to undertake urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that characterized its previous work in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	3
We are deeply concerned by the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated by one side against the other, despite the clear expressions of disgust by the international community and the Security Council.	3
We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the commitment set out in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, in particular by those most active in this trade.	3
This is important to strengthen the Mission's ability to provide meaningful protection to the Congolese civilian population, which has fallen victim to a clear humanitarian catastrophe, as Mr. Doss emphasized, and to widespread human rights violations, in particular acts of violence against women and children.	3
Actions that may reduce confidence in or harm the outcome of negotiations must stop and be reversed.	3
The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow the civilian population of Gaza to access water, work, trade, medical care and education - that is, their basic needs.	3
My delegation remains concerned about the continued deterioration of the security situation in Iraq.	3
We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
We were prevented from even condemning the violence and supporting a peace plan drawn up by Syria's neighbors.	3
Of great concern is the intense rhetoric from both sides, the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
Once again, Egypt demands an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	3
It outlines issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise issues of gender equality, including with Somali leaders.	3
We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process created for this purpose has failed.	3
We have noted with concern the Secretary-General's assessment that many of the factors that sparked the 2006 crisis remain in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d'Ivoire, as the Council may have attested in the statement I made earlier today.	3
He also stresses that it is Rwanda's duty to use its strong influence to ensure that the RCD does not take such actions.	3
According to these decisions, this body must demand that the United States government immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for committing acts of terrorism or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose judicial system has been pursuing him for years.	3
More efforts must be made by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations in preventive activities, such as providing sanitation and safe water.	3
“The Council expresses deep concern over reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya tribe members into Abyei town and its surrounding areas, which may bring about significant changes in the ethnic fabric of the region.	3
We urge Israel to adhere to its obligations with regard to the population in the occupied territories.	3
However, failure to intervene effectively to restore stability in that country truly threatens the effectiveness of the international community, in addition to costing it enormous resources.	3
Despite all efforts to restore peace and security, we remain concerned about the recent major setbacks to stabilization efforts in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
Moreover, Chile considers that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains only a condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians.	3
The Republic of South Sudan is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the border areas of both the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
“The Council notes with concern the challenges facing social and economic development, with a marked deterioration in the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians.	3
This is an international obligation that States must fulfill to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	3
In this regard, although the fight against terrorism is being treated more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of real joint efforts to find a greater international response to terrorism.	3
Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, for the report, none of the eight key standards have yet been fully implemented.	3
“The Security Council notes with deep concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, which were scheduled to take place on 29 November 2009 in accordance with the communication of the Permanent Advisory Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement of 18 May 2009, endorsed by all Ivorian political actors.	3
Monitoring and identification of violations of the arms embargo must be strengthened, and targeted sanctions applied where appropriate, in order to limit the potentially destructive effects of that process in the Somali context.	3
Protecting civilians is a long-neglected duty in Somalia.	3
The dissident group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal to move the presidential elections forward from July to April 30 this year.	3
However, it is unacceptable for Israel to use its legitimate security concerns as a justification for imposing measures that affect an entire population in an arbitrary manner and in violation of international humanitarian law.	3
But we are concerned that a key factor in decision-making is being undermined by the lack of political consensus.	3
A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	3
We are concerned that the security situation remains problematic.	3
We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	3
In this regard, we would like to repeat what we said on previous occasions, which is that the most dangerous thing this investigation faces is the continued exploitation of some parties, in our region or outside it, of the investigation proceedings to jump to preconceived political conclusions that are not relevant to the requirements of the investigation and are not based on evidence. And solid evidence.	3
However, the security situation remains a cause for everyone's concern, despite the decrease in the number of security-related incidents in December 2011 and January 2012, compared to the previous two months last year.	3
But we are concerned about reports of increasing tension between the ruling parties and the opposition parties.	3
But, as I said in Tuesday's open session, events must be seen in context, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one side and turns a blind eye to everything else that happens in the region.	3
At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bomb attacks and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by their government's policy. We also reject the use of these scattered actions to cast doubt on the legitimate exercise of self-defense by the Palestinian people, and to justify activities, which are widely or selectively committed against the Palestinian population.	3
“The Security Council expresses its deep concern about the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people.	3
This Council should not allow that strategy to be rewarded by responding to terrorism rather than addressing terrorism itself. Rather, it should be met with rejection, not appeasement.	3
In this regard, the Council condemns, in the strongest terms, the continued threats and acts of intimidation against members of the Mission.	3
Let me begin by reiterating the European Union's deep concern about the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions resulting from the conflict there.	3
However, concerns remain for the 2.3 million people still living in a crisis situation.	3
However, we are concerned by recent developments, including increased tensions between members of local communities and ISAF forces.	3
However, the situation remains a source of concern, given the long border between our two countries, which is difficult to control.	3
The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
The Council must call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the area.	3
By thinking of taking initiatives that practically reward this strategy, the Council will only embolden the terrorists and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
He refused to arrest Ali Kushayb and Ahmed Haroun.	3
The Palestinians must end public incitement to violence and do everything in their power to prevent extremists from attacking Israel, provoking an Israeli response.	3
We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	3
I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June assessing the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the difficult humanitarian situation and the issue of the protection of civilians.	3
The situation on the ground is also worrying from a humanitarian standpoint. The Secretary-General stresses that Iraq is going through a major crisis, and stated that the situation is deteriorating.	3
At the same time, Germany and the European Union have repeatedly in the past condemned terrorist crimes that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis.	3
There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remains an important challenge that must be taken into account.	3
This is what makes the Iranian leadership's irresponsible threatening rhetoric even more disturbing.	3
Under international law, Israel is obligated, as the occupying state, to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and is obligated to preserve civilian property.	3
Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - in particular the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	3
Last Sunday, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of the Hamas movement, Hamas leader Haniyeh refused to allow President Abbas to remain in office until the internal division was resolved.	3
As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident justifies the bleak picture regarding the security situation.	3
In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its commitment to ensuring full and safe access to humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	3
We consider Armenia's position an open and direct challenge to the conflict resolution process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	3
The Togolese delegation believes that all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel region from falling into complete insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	3
At the same time, other essential elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall performance of the judiciary, and strengthening law enforcement institutions with a view to reducing organized crime and ethnic violence and bringing all criminals to justice.	3
This will require a clear position, especially, frankly, from the United States of America.	3
Meanwhile, President Bashir threatens the international community with revenge, and thus more crimes.	3
In the current situation, which is an extremely difficult situation, we call on both Israelis and Palestinians to prevent escalation of the conflict and to begin implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace.	3
Despite these challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that approximately 50 percent of the Afghan people live in areas where responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
The humanitarian consequences of continuing violence in Iraq are a source of grave concern to my delegation.	3
It is time for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most basic rights of the Palestinian people, and to break the vicious cycle of violence resulting from Israel's continuing and ongoing illegal occupation of Palestinian territories.	3
All of this requires waging a powerful war against entrenched informal actors, whose presence poses a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of its sovereignty by the Afghan state.	3
We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and the efforts of many others, the Council was unable to condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	3
But despite these achievements, challenges to the government's authority and effective control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	3
It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying power, bears direct responsibility for the commission of these crimes.	3
In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable groups in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	3
It is part of a mantra that is constantly repeated before this Council, and the repetition does not make it more true. It ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights, and does not acknowledge the excessive difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize harm to Palestinian lives while terrorists do not Those you face care more about the lives of Palestinians than they care about the lives of Israelis.	3
We note the security concerns that Israel says force it to continue its aircraft flights, especially allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to Resolution 1701 (2006).	3
The lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from settling in their communities of origin.	3
The German government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan) (spoke in English): First of all, I would like to apologize for asking for the floor again, as we considered it inappropriate and counterproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and his attempt to mislead the Security Council into remaining silent about them.	3
The ongoing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people remains a tragic embodiment of the consequences of the refusal to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its resolutions.	3
This political incident was strongly denounced through a press release issued by the office of President Ernest Bai Kroma, as well as by numerous press releases issued by political interest groups, including the APC, the People's Movement for Democratic Change and the Independent Commission for the Media. The Political Parties Registration Committee and the Good Governance Campaign.	3
We could go on to mention widespread poverty, problems in natural resource management, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, thousands more former combatants awaiting reintegration, unreformed security sectors, extensive human rights violations, and many other threats that are likely to fueling a new conflict.	3
In that regard, we believe that destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be absolutely condemned.	3
While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemn the incident and demand the arrest of the perpetrators, each side has claimed that the other side is responsible for provoking the incident.	3
We would also like to express our concern that the return of these incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, making it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo situation that is acceptable to both parties.	3
Israel must also refrain from taking unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would change the status quo or undermine confidence.	3
Combined with fanaticism and deep roots in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values ​​that we are trying to instill in the new institutions formed there, and thus our efforts are in vain.	3
As a result, the security threats to many countries in Africa and beyond, including member states of this Council, have been crossed, exposing their vulnerabilities.	3
The failure of any Member State to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and Sudan should not be exempt from this.	3
We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of a marathon runner, because the drafting of the constitution must be completed by 20 April and its adoption completed by 22 May.	3
The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents post-conflict societies from recovering sustainably.	3
The Afghan authorities and the international community must make clear that this behavior is unacceptable.	3
Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in this regard.	3
Although the President acted within his constitutional powers, I discussed with him concerns regarding the possibility that the pardons issued on 25 December 2009 might reinforce the perception of impunity.	3
First, it caused an ongoing humanitarian emergency that also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	3
Therefore, Greece insists on the need to clarify the sixth preambular paragraph - urging the Council “to make progress towards the resumption of negotiations to reach a comprehensive settlement” - as it should be emphasized once again that those negotiations should take place between the two communities.	3
In that regard, we would like to go further to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to subdue the most powerful insurgents and enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as much as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
In his report, the Secretary-General notes some improvement measures in all of these areas except for the central issue of local government reform, in particular, decentralization, where progress is lacking.	3
Some concerns were expressed - not long ago by several presidential candidates - about the integrity of the recording.	3
In order to continue this struggle, it is imperative that the international community make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
My delegation strongly condemns these acts of violence and extends its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
In return, the authorities in Belgrade must end their obstructionist approach, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo’s public institutions. The “vacant seat policy” entails a great risk of writing Kosovo’s history without the participation of Kosovo Serbs.	3
We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
We urge Israel to take further action to remove outposts in accordance with the Roadmap, and to address the growing threat posed by settler extremism.	3
A larger UN presence is indeed vital, but for the added value of our organization to be fully effective, adequate funds must be provided for both staff and security. Mr. Eide reminded us of this a few moments ago.	3
As for the military aspects of security sector reform, the government has made clear that it wants to rely largely on bilateral aid to build the military's capabilities.	3
In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continued lack of progress in the areas of freedom of movement of minorities, sustainable returns and relevant representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector at large.	3
My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and outrage that have resulted from this terrible incident. We particularly appreciate the Security Council's quick reaction to this heinous crime.	3
In fact, given the history of foreign intervention, such directives would not only be questioned by various sectors of society but could also exacerbate the problem.	3
Above all, our concerns were related to the insistence of the Pristina authorities to implement the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for reaching a settlement in Kosovo.	3
In particular, we would like to express our deep concern about the stagnation in Haiti's socio-economic development and food security.	3
But we note that without a strong justice and security sector, developing peace and stability can be threatened.	3
The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of these actions, through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and the Group of Friends of Syria, with significant and widespread participation.	3
The threat posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the drug trade to the security and stability of Afghanistan is a real phenomenon that must be constantly addressed.	3
We condemn all terrorist acts committed in Afghanistan, especially the most recent one committed against the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the governments and peoples of the affected countries and to the families and relatives of the victims.	3
Collecting timely, objective, reliable, accurate, and accurate information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to formulating the Council’s responses, as well as strengthening action to prevent sexual violence.	3
True establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires the formation of an army and the establishment of an effective and democratic justice system and police force.	3
The international community - including through the auspices of the United Nations - should use diplomatic influence and provide technical assistance in areas such as political, security and justice sector reforms, the drafting of new constitutions, legal frameworks and electoral institutions and the holding of elections.	3
It calls for adherence to international law and for all parties to implement their obligations and the road map in order to achieve the vision of two states living side by side in peace and security.	3
Under these circumstances, in which huge disparities and political, economic, and social marginalization combine, a process has emerged that seeks to bring about change in the prevailing system, and seeks to bring about economic and political change and find alternatives that allow participation and open new areas and means of expression, which include, in short, demands related to basic rights.	3
UNIFIL soldiers must fully implement their mandate with the aim of eliminating threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
My delegation believes that to prevent new outbreaks of violence and to stabilize northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring social and economic stability among the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
Withholding this level of funding would paralyze any government, let alone an authority under occupation, and if these funds are not immediately released, this action will threaten the state-building gains achieved by the Palestinian Authority, including promoting good governance that benefits the people. Palestinian security forces and the development of security forces that maintain law and order in the West Bank.	3
Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a concern shared by all Member States of the United Nations and the international community as a whole.	3
But the serious danger remains that as a result of that decision - which violates the documents issued by the Bonn and Berlin conferences - the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal divisions in the power structures.	3
They are the ones who do all these things, and then they ask for protection and guarantees and use them as a mask in order to blackmail and obtain more concessions.	3
Preventing illegal border crossings is vital to combating terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
Unless the Government addresses these issues, they could represent serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	3
To avoid a new wave of violence, both parties and the international community must take immediate action.	3
While we strongly condemn these practices as they represent a flagrant violation of international conventions and humanitarian laws and norms, we call on the international community, the members of the Quartet, and all active parties to intervene immediately and decisively to force Israel to put an end to such actions, which constitute a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East region. Violence only begets violence, which may plunge the region into a spiral from which it is difficult to emerge.	3
In this regard, we are deeply concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the repressive activities of the remaining elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, disputes among warlords and the drug trade.	3
Somali leaders must work toward a political process open to all who are willing to renounce violent opposition.	3
Demands for information from UNMIK and KFOR were met with a typical response from the Corps Commander, who said that, under his limited authority, he could not provide additional information.	3
Although these contacts have been constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the two parties are expected to submit proposals regarding territory and security within 90 days, have not yet taken place.	3
We urge the Government of Haiti to take firm action to prevent such violence and ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice.	3
The Russian Federation once again calls on the Israeli and Palestinian sides to exercise restraint, a high spirit of responsibility, and to reject unilateralism.	3
I cannot stress enough the threat that the unavailability of military helicopters poses to the operational effectiveness of the force.	3
Beyond the area of ​​responsibility of the United Nations Mission in Eastern Chad, other developments are also causing concern.	3
Also, although the overall security situation remains calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste officially assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, illicit trafficking and illegal border crossings should be seen as a cause for concern, as well as Tensions related to demonstrations that took place in Dili last July.	3
Lack of such engagement will prevent progress in addressing important issues of public administration, and will achieve no progress in improving Kosovo's image in the minds of the international community.	3
Despite our assessment that achieving a complete ceasefire is difficult at this time, I still believe that the international community must make its position clear, which is the need to stop the attacks immediately, and for Israel to make more credible efforts to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while Work is being done urgently to create the conditions to stop these attacks.	3
The Court of First Instance’s push to issue an arrest warrant against a head of state on March 4, 2009, sparked massive popular reactions and dealt a new setback to hopes for peace and stability.	3
We are also concerned about the resurgence of cholera cases, although the mortality rate appears to be slowly declining.	3
However, in 2007, after the arrest warrants for Haroun and Kushayb were issued, President Bashir publicly refused to implement them, defying the Security Council's authority and saying that Haroun had done what he was ordered to do.	3
In this context, the Council reaffirms that the main cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA's refusal to comply with the relevant substantive provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, and reiterates its request that UNITA comply with its obligations to disarm and allow governmental administration to extend to the territory it controls.	3
In describing this unfortunate incident, the President stressed that it was malicious, unacceptable, and entailed potential violence in the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
The MDC candidate has little or no access to the media in Zimbabwe; He is prohibited from organizing campaigns freely; Campaign buses and cars were reportedly seized by the state, allegedly because of their illegal registration.	3
Bosnia and Herzegovina expresses its concern about the current political impasse in forming a new government and defining a clear constitutional reform process.	3
We should acknowledge our great concern about the situation in Afghanistan.	3
We called on the Council on several occasions to take action to force Israel to stop its military attacks, to ensure the protection of the civilian population and to stop all unlawful punitive measures through which it is causing a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.	3
And here Cuba is coming once again to the Security Council to strongly denounce and condemn the complicity of the United States government and its absolute responsibility for the release of this person.	3
Africans have clearly expressed their concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe.	3
The European Union is deeply concerned about the continuing cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
President Al-Bashir took diplomatic retaliatory measures against the Kenyan decision and threatened to impose economic and trade sanctions.	3
In that context, we believe it is important for the Security Council to pay the utmost attention to the threats posed by fundamentalist and extremist religious organizations such as Hizb ut-Tahrir and we urge the Council to impose severe sanctions on terrorist organizations.	3
It is with great concern that I must inform you of the escalation in criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	3
In addition, Israeli air violations of the Blue Line continued on a regular basis, in direct violation of resolution 1701 (2006).	3
In this regard, we take note of the statements made by the main elected representatives of Kosovo, who immediately condemned that crime and demanded that its perpetrators be brought to justice.	3
Therefore, the international community must take the necessary action to prevent Israel from continuing the reprehensible process of destruction it has initiated in Gaza, and affirm its rejection of all these Israeli practices that constitute a violation of international law and international humanitarian law.	3
This remains a source of constant concern to us.	3
However, we also oppose and condemn extrajudicial executions.	3
We condemn all acts and crimes committed in Kosovo with ethnic motives.	3
However, we do not believe that sovereignty obligates the Security Council to stand idly by when governments commit massacres against their people, thus threatening regional peace and security.	3
As Prosecutor, I will face any legal challenge brought by President Al-Bashir and other defendants in court.	3
Azerbaijan's refusal to enter into direct negotiations with elected representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the main obstacles to resolving the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	3
The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon issued statements strongly condemning the criminal actions of Fatah al-Islam as attacks on Lebanon’s stability and sovereignty.	3
The United States urges the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble their efforts to examine students' personal records.	3
When the situation in Haiti is addressed within the framework of the United Nations, all attention is almost always focused on so-called security issues, which in practice reduces the urgent attention needed to the country's serious structural, economic and social problems.	3
With regard to the humanitarian situation, Guatemala is concerned that, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 20 million people in the Sahel region are in need of humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
We are also concerned about the very high rate of unemployment and widespread poverty in the country.	3
But we are concerned that the violence could cause a portion of the population to stay away from polling sites in the south and elsewhere.	3
Since the beginning of the political impasse following the elections held on 29 March, the Secretary-General has expressed his concern about the process and politically motivated violence.	3
However, in other areas, progress has not met expectations and many challenges remain.	3
My Government believes not only that these actions are contrary to international law, but that they undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is the main element in the fight against terrorism.	3
We challenge anyone to say that there is now a single battle taking place in any corner of Sudan.	3
Romania reiterates that any terrorist act is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
The French authorities are deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the situation in the northern Gaza Strip over the past week.	3
This disturbing pattern of activities is a serious concern that threatens to undermine the credibility of United Nations operations.	3
That is why we condemn terrorism.	3
“The Security Council remains deeply concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic.	3
This is unacceptable, and must be completely condemned, especially by the Security Council, using the means at its disposal.	3
The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a major concern.	3
What everyone needs to do is reject the hard-line voices that find comfort in the old ways and believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching a historic compromise.	3
The situation along the Lebanese border with Syria remains worrying.	3
“The Security Council also expresses its concern about the increasing tensions in the Ituri region and calls on all parties to exercise restraint.	3
Blue Nile State is also still a source of concern for us.	3
Therefore, United Nations counter-terrorism bodies should address these shortcomings with more seriousness and dedication.	3
In fact, Azerbaijan itself is in violation of those resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to continue negotiations within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as through various contacts among themselves.	3
I expressed the deep concern of the Council and the Secretary-General about the recent increase in tensions between North and South, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	3
The Russian delegation expresses its deep regret and concern regarding the information related to the continuation of violence in Darfur.	3
I am deeply concerned about the recent escalation between Gaza and Israel.	3
It is clear that these conditions represent the single greatest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and that these conditions, if allowed to persist, threaten to undo the progress made during nearly three years.	3
Security and stability remain a major challenge.	3
However, the operation also demonstrated the extent of the challenges that Liberia's security sector continues to face, especially with regard to logistics, communications, and the mobility of the police and immigration services.	3
Pakistan is deeply concerned about the report’s conclusions that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel region have been exacerbated by the repercussions of the Libyan crisis.	3
We condemn in particular any attempt to force the Mission into any kind of so-called joint governance, as well as any interference with the unilateral powers of the Special Representative.	3
We note that civil society organizations have expressed their deep concern in this regard.	3
It is clear that all institutions of law and order in Iraq face serious challenges.	3
Political pressures on UNMIK have increased significantly with attempts to challenge its role within resolution 1244 (1999) and the constitutional framework.	3
There is no doubt today that the real intention was to prevent the details of his reckless destructive acts committed on the orders of the CIA from being made public.	3
The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report regarding, inter alia, human rights and the situation of women and children.	3
We have serious concerns about this law, as it could have far-reaching consequences.	3
However, we believe that a sudden withdrawal will have adverse results and will create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in light of the fact that the conditions conducive to the hoped-for, large-scale investment and sustainable development have not yet been fully established.	3
At the outset, I must express our deep concern about the security situation in this country.	3
I must say that the topic chosen for our discussion today is very challenging although it is interesting.	3
As the Secretary-General's report (S/2004/634) makes clear, tackling the problem is a difficult challenge.	3
However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation remains a cause for concern.	3
I urge Hamas to respond to these appeals.	3
He reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, which he described as sending false and unwanted messages, ahead of the 2012 elections, and would undermine and hinder the gains that have been made in reshaping the image of the country, and in the field of building and consolidating peace, which were achieved through strenuous efforts and with the help of our partners. Development experts and the international community.	3
Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has proven that it is as incapable of being a partner in peace as it is of seeking reform and democratic governance for its people.	3
First and foremost, security concerns remain paramount.	3
It is clear that the conditions for implementing this mechanism are not available in the case of Darfur.	3
First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West Africa Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is hampering intelligence sharing and early warning.	3
France strongly condemns these attacks and calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint.	3
The political debate is likely to be heated, as several election-related court challenges have already been filed.	3
The report underscores the alarming picture of the situation in the Sahel region and the related security, economic and humanitarian concerns.	3
Second, Mr. Covic expressed concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority - the Kosovo Serbs - risk losing out to mechanical majority voting. I would say that I think the most important aspect of democracy that can be expected is for one to participate, exercise democratic rights and vote.	3
We express our deep concern about the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
In Egypt, we have been calling for the early and peaceful transfer of power to a civilian government.	3
The situation of minorities remains a cause for concern, especially with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
We, once again, condemn the killing of civilians, whether by the Palestinian or the Israeli side.	3
Now top priority must be given to meeting the challenge of establishing local and regional administrations in areas retaken from Al-Shabaab.	3
We urge the parties to act with restraint and avoid provocative actions or statements that could spark further violence.	3
The United States urges the Haitian authorities to fulfill their pledge to fill all six vacancies on the Supreme Court by October 3, 2011.	3
We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections may be at risk of being eroded by the lack of progress in forming the government.	3
The challenges facing the country require a united, common will from Haiti's leaders.	3
However, the possibility of a complete collapse of law and order, in addition to the collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of Palestinian institutions of self-government, remains.	3
The negative impact of the Libyan situation will grow, which poses a threat to continued peace and stability in the region. China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
One thing that remains a major concern of mine is that the efforts that Liberians are making to rebuild their judicial system will take a long time, so the system itself is likely to remain weak and vulnerable in the short term.	3
In 1993, that vision was vague at best, and at the time, it was impossible to define an ultimate goal that would come close to meeting the concerns of both peoples.	3
We have noted the caution shown by the Secretary-General and the Technical Assessment Mission with regard to security sector reform, in particular with regard to the National Police of Timor-Leste.	3
As I explained, I am confident that your esteemed council will not care about these false accusations that are far from the truth and the lowest standards of professionalism.	3
We took note of the concern regarding the implementation of the joint statement of 2 April 2009, which was referred to in the report.	3
This sparked serious tensions with local communities, as well as threats to MINURSO from some former military commanders of the Conference who have now integrated into the Congolese army.	3
We consider any deviation from that principle unacceptable, not to mention that the fragile situation in the region may lead to the spread of instability.	3
Haitian political and civil society leaders continue to speak up for national consensus in key areas, such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.	3
The Jordanian government stresses the need for the Israeli government to completely and directly stop operations of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip and in all occupied Palestinian territories, end the policy of destroying Palestinian infrastructure and homes, stop extrajudicial killings and impose collective punishment on the Palestinian people, and put an end to violations. practiced by Israel against him.	3
However, we remain concerned that there is an overemphasis on visits to developing countries.	3
As the United Nations Support Mission in Afghanistan, we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end that situation, especially on the southern border.	3
While Hezbollah's actions are regrettable, and as I have said, Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force must be condemned.	3
Pakistan's new democratic government has inherited a daunting legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	3
Further development of the situation in this direction could threaten efforts to reform and build the country, and in the long term it would threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	3
The situation in Syria is of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
We are particularly concerned about the lack of training for mid-level civil servants, in addition to the significant problems that continue to surround the judicial field.	3
The recent rulings by an Indonesian Court of Appeal, overturning four convictions by the ad hoc Human Rights Court, while outside the mandate of the Mission, have a direct impact on the larger issue of accountability for crimes.	3
I am particularly concerned about the instability that could arise if the political and socio-economic situation continues to deteriorate.	3
However, this requires an American will that places Middle East peace at the top of its priorities, overcoming the neglect and exclusion that has continued for about seven years and led to the aggravation of the situation in the region.	3
We are also concerned about the situation of those involved in the reconstruction of the country.	3
We are deeply concerned about the insistence of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement on refusing to participate in the talks.	3
The Council condemns all actions taken unilaterally with the intention of creating facts on the ground that would prejudice the outcome of the negotiations.	3
The Council stresses that all those responsible for violating international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as anyone who instructed the commission of such acts, will be held accountable.	3
Statements such as “The Palestinian people do not love their children” or “The Palestinian people are sending their children to death because of their hatred for Israel” are statements that smack of racism and reflect the kind of approach that should be rejected outright - and I am trying to do that now.	3
Sharing blame, creating scapegoats who bear responsibility for the failure in Afghanistan, and demanding that those who actually do a lot do the most unfair and unacceptable practices will ultimately lead to psychological defeat.	3
We cannot send a message that terrorists will be safe and be satisfied with the usual condemnations.	3
The recent fatwa issued by the Ulema Council condemning drug and other related activities could be very helpful in thwarting opium poppy production.	3
We therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends of Haiti to view positively these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	3
Peoples not only aspire to, but also demand, that more pluralistic and representative governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	3
Timor-Leste continues to face significant challenges in reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities, especially for its young population.	3
The Council calls on the Government of Sudan to immediately withdraw from the Abyei area.	3
Security sector reform remains one of the major challenges to long-term peace and stability.	3
Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only credible deterrent against crimes of grave concern to the international community.	3
We are deeply concerned that unless all sides exercise a strong will to stop acts of terrorism and violence, the peace process will not be successful.	3
We note that in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continued illegal settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories.	3
We are therefore disappointed that the Secretary-General's report (S/2011/540) recommended only a partial reduction in the troop increase.	3
Now, what Afghanistan has achieved is being eroded by the serious challenges the country faces to its security and stability.	3
While piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to lose sight of the fact that the solution to this problem must be achieved on land, not at sea. A comprehensive solution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
The second point I would like to highlight today is our continuing concern for the well-being of the innocent residents of Gaza and in the towns and cities of southern Israel.	3
Finally, the Afghan leadership must combat drugs.	3
I also condemn Hezbollah's reckless disdain for the wishes of Lebanon's elected government and the interests of the Lebanese people and the wider region.	3
“The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the two terrorist attacks that took place in Algiers on 11 December 2007, near the Supreme Court and the United Nations offices, which resulted in a large number of deaths and injuries, and expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism, to their families, and to the people and Government of Algeria.	3
I also remember how unacceptable it was for Israelis to talk about the 1967 borders, and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to suggest evacuating Israeli settlements.	3
The Secretary-General's recent report on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expressed the importance of disarming Hezbollah and ending arms smuggling across the Lebanese-Syrian border.	3
I expressed my condemnation of the terrorist attack that occurred on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.	3
We are concerned about increased insurgency activity in some areas of Afghanistan.	3
Today's discussion addresses a pressing issue.	3
It is important that cases of domestic violence and sexual assault are formally prosecuted in accordance with the new criminal law.	3
States cannot ignore this basic obligation without any consequences for their illegal behavior.	3
My country has repeatedly expressed its concern about the civilian population in that area, and considers it important for the mission to deploy there to protect them.	3
The incident in northern Mitrovica has clearly shown that, despite the Security Council's mandate regarding the reconstitution of UNMIK, the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo is increasingly moving away from the principle of status neutrality, undermining the existing international presence. .	3
