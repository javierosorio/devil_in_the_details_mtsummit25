Requests the Secretary-General and relevant United Nations agencies, inter alia, through consultation with women and women-led organizations, to develop, as appropriate, effective mechanisms to ensure the protection of women and girls from violence, including in particular sexual violence, in and around United Nations-run refugee and internally displaced persons camps, in all disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes and in efforts to reform the justice and security sectors assisted by the United Nations.	4
The Council reaffirms that an end to impunity is essential if a society in conflict or post-conflict situations is to go beyond past injustices against civilians and to prevent such injustices in the future.	4
30. The UNMIL community police initiative has strengthened ties with the community.	2
:: Take measures to ensure the protection of and respect for the human rights of women and girls, in particular those relating to the Constitution, the electoral system, the police and the judiciary.	2
"The Security Council reaffirms the importance of the work of the Committees established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004) and continues to provide support and guidance to them.	4
In accordance with paragraph 32 of this resolution, the Monitoring Team operates under the direction of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) and has the following responsibilities:	2
15. Pro-Government militias have played an important role in the Government &apos; s efforts to establish security in CÃ´te d &apos; Ivoire, particularly in the west of the country.	2
The first is to determine how best the Committee can ensure that the sanctions measures contribute to the promotion of peace and stability in Afghanistan, and the second is the continuing judicial challenges faced by Member States in implementing these measures.	1
In this regard, the Security Council encourages all States in the region to sign and implement the Code of Conduct as soon as possible and calls upon them to take further effective measures at the national level to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea.	4
Since 18 September 2014, no combat operations have been carried out to counter an "imminent and serious threat."	1
The Border Intelligence Guard is under the direct command of military intelligence officers in the division where they are required to work, otherwise they are subject to the normal chain of command in the armed forces.	2
23. During recent field visits to refugee camps, internally displaced persons sites and adjacent villages, the Mission recorded fewer reports of human rights violations.	2
119. In view of this situation, the Team has taken several initiatives to fulfil its mandate to monitor and propose recommendations for improving the travel ban, including increased contacts with Member States and key international organizations; investigations into the use of fraudulent travel documents by terrorists and ways to improve national and international regulations; regular discussions with INTERPOL on ways to enhance coordination between the United Nations and INTERPOL; investigation of the emerging trend of free movement and visa-exempt areas and their links with United Nations sanctions; and the relationship of refugee and asylum-seeking practices to United Nations counter-terrorism efforts.	2
The report also indicated that incidents involving the use of rocket-propelled grenades and relatively heavy artillery to counter pirates had decreased from 43 in 2011 to 3 in 2013.	2
56. The Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea &apos; s police and security forces systematically resort to violence and sanctions, which constitute a gross violation of human rights, in order to create a climate of fear that inhibits any opposition to the current regime and the ideology on which it is based.	1
2. The offender shall be punished by imprisonment for three to ten years;	1
:: Fact-finding mechanisms should be established sufficiently early in the outbreak of crises to enable them to contribute to preventing further violations.	4
Decides that all Member States shall freeze without delay all funds, other financial assets and economic resources on their territories that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the entities or individuals mentioned in [the annex to the resolution imposing sanctions] or [those designated by the Sanctions Committee who participate or are complicit in ordering, controlling or otherwise directing serious human rights violations against persons in [the State concerned], including participation in or complicity in planning, leading, ordering or carrying out attacks, including aerial bombardments, against the civilian population and civilian facilities, in violation of international law; or entities or individuals acting on their behalf or at their direction], and decides further that all Member States shall ensure that no funds, financial assets or economic resources are made available, by their nationals or by any entities or persons within their territories, to or for the benefit of the entities or persons mentioned in [the annex to the resolution imposing sanctions] or individuals designated by the Committee.	1

Demands that all parties to armed conflict immediately take appropriate measures to protect civilians, including women and children, from all forms of sexual violence, including measures such as enforcement of appropriate military disciplinary measures, adherence to the principle of command responsibility, training of forces in the absolute prohibition of all forms of sexual violence against civilians, exposing misconceptions that fuel sexual violence, and investigating candidates for national military and security forces to ensure that those associated with serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, including sexual violence, are excluded.	4
A. Committing or participating in the commission of international crimes	1
"The Security Council is deeply concerned about attacks against humanitarian workers, which violate the rules of international law.	3
The Committee also noted that the Democratic People &apos; s Republic of Korea had been abducted or otherwise forcibly caused by the disappearance of more than 200,000 or more persons from China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and other countries, including after the end of the Korean war.	1
A similar obligation is assumed by the rebels for all crimes they may have committed, whether or not the perpetrators have been identified and punished.	1
"The Security Council stresses the importance of assisting Member States in promoting women's full and equal participation in post-conflict electoral processes and constitutional reforms.	4
In closed consultations that followed, the Special Representative and the Special Envoy addressed some issues related to security sector reform and the establishment of a rapid reaction force within FARDC, the electoral process and the general elections.	2
In the run-up to 20 May 2002, Mr. Lobato and his supporters organized marches for veterans in Dili.	1
10. The measures taken by States cover the prohibited activities of non-State actors as described in paragraph 2 of resolution 1540 (2004) with regard to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, and controls on related materials, in accordance with paragraph 3 of the resolution.	1
The Syrian Government also believes that the problem of the so-called Syrian internally displaced persons is highly artificial and hopes that they will return home and that their presence will not be exploited for political purposes. The marked improvement in the security situation has led to the return of large groups of them to their country and to their actions, from which terrorist groups have prevented them.	1
75. In the conflict in Darfur, the Government faces resistance from at least two armed groups, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement.	1
He also visited the refugee camp in Laayoune.	4
Improved relations between Chad and the Sudan and the vigilance of the national security forces and the joint border security forces were also mentioned as important factors contributing to this.	2
As you are aware, on 12 December 2000, I witnessed the signing of the Agreement between the Government of the State of Eritrea and the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, which took place in Algiers at a solemn ceremony hosted by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.	2

11. In theory, any importation of light weapons requires an exemption from ECOWAS in Abuja.	1
241. Based on its analysis of other sources and its own investigative work, the Commission found attacks on villages in Darfur by the Sudanese Government armed forces and Janjaweed throughout the conflict period, with certain periods of peak intensity.	1
The Council authorized the deployment of ONUB, which would consist of a maximum of 5,650 military personnel, including 200 observers, 125 staff officers and up to 120 civilian police, as well as an appropriate number of civilian personnel, and, for the initial period of six months, for the deployment of ONUB, effective June 2004, would initially consist of the current troops of the African Mission in Burundi (AMIB).	1
In the area of combat operations, the principle of proportionality remains a largely subjective criterion, based on a balance between expectation and waiting for military gain and the actual loss of civilian lives or the destruction of civilian objects.	1
In the case of Darfur, this oppressive and discriminatory intent can be identified on many occasions by some Arab militias, as well as by the central Government: the systematic attacks on villages inhabited by civilians (or the majority of them civilians) belonging to certain "African tribes" (the Fur, the Masalit and the Zagawa), the systematic destruction and burning of these villages, and the forced displacement of civilian villagers testify to clear persecution.	1
Reiterates its appeal to national authorities to end impunity, including by bringing to justice without delay perpetrators of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to take into account, when selecting candidates for official positions, including key positions in the armed forces, the national police and other security services, the past work of candidates in terms of respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law.	3
Council members expressed concern at the increase in piracy and armed robbery at sea and reports of hostage-taking in the Gulf of Guinea, and at the adverse effects of this activity on security, trade and economic activities in the subregion.	1
Although threats from illegal militias in the west will remain low, for most areas of Afghanistan, these forces will continue to pose the second greatest threat to regional security, following threats related to drugs and crimes.	1
10. Invites the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on opportunities and challenges for cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations in the maintenance of international peace and security, and encourages the Secretary-General to explore with international organizations the possibility of concluding agreements to establish a framework for the cooperation of regional organizations with and contributions to United Nations-led peacekeeping operations, taking due account of previously identified guidelines for cooperation between the United Nations and certain regional organizations;	4
I welcome the efforts of States to ensure that suspects have access to a fair trial and humane and safe prison conditions, in line with international human rights standards.	2
22. Requests the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the support of the international community and MONUC, to urgently develop and implement a comprehensive national strategy for security sector reform, based, inter alia, on the outcome of the security sector round table held in February 2008, with a view to establishing professional security organizations in the areas of defence, police and the administration of justice that provide protection to civilians, are well managed and act in accordance with the Constitution and with respect for the rule of law, human rights and international humanitarian law, and urges the Congolese Government to ensure the sustainability of the support of its partners in this area, in particular by giving priority to the reform of the administration and command structures of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other security forces, and reiterates its appeal to the Congolese authorities to establish a vetting mechanism that, when selecting candidates for official positions, including key positions in the armed forces, the national police and other security services, takes into account the conduct of former candidates in respect for international humanitarian law and human rights;	4
The time has indeed come for the international community, in particular the Security Council, to take effective measures to confront the illegal and criminal policies and practices of the Israeli regime and to put an end to its State terrorism against the Palestinian people and other peoples of the region.	1
140. On 14 December 2004, talks between the Government of the Sudan and a delegation of the National Movement for Reform and Development began in N &apos; Djamena, with Chadian mediation, and on 17 December the parties signed two protocols, one on humanitarian access and the other on security issues.	2

At the request of the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo, MONUC supported the efforts of the Alliance for Integration into the Armed Forces.	2
There are also widespread and confirmed allegations that some members of the Janjaweed have been integrated into the police.	1
17. The weekly quadripartite meetings allowed the Committees, together with UNOMIG and the CIS peacekeeping force, to discuss security-related matters in the conflict zone on a regular basis.	4
The threat posed by Al-Qaida and the Taliban	3

The Assistant Secretary-General reported that armed groups continued to terrorize the population in areas under their control by committing killings, abductions, torture, ill-treatment and other grave human rights violations, including the destruction of homes and the seizure of property, and also reported continuing allegations of human rights violations committed by some volunteer battalions under the control of the Government.	1
This key remaining provision of the resolution has not yet been implemented, which amounts to a reaffirmation of the decision of all Lebanese to abide by it in the 1989 Taif Agreement following the civil war.	3

The Group discussed areas of cooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Action Unit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Central Asian Regional Office of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Regional Counter-Terrorism Structure and initiated contacts with other regional organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), which established the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) and the African Union (AU), which established a counter-terrorism centre in Algeria.	2
The Operation &apos; s military component will continue to implement its new concept of operations and cooperate with the Licorne force to assist the parties in implementing the Facilitator &apos; s proposals for the reintegration of Forces nouvelles personnel into the national police and army and to prepare contingency plans on possible stabilization interventions to prevent violence aimed at disrupting the peace process.	1
Efforts in these areas, complemented by the activities of the working groups established to implement the agreements reached between the Presidents of the Russian Federation and Georgia in Sochi in March 2003 (see S/2003/412, para. 5), seek to address the urgent concerns of the parties and thus enhance confidence between them with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of commencing negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, using the paper entitled "Basic principles for the distribution of competences between Tbilisi and Sukhumi" and the transmittal letter annexed thereto as a starting point (see S/2002/88, para.	2
Mr. Malik wanted to send United Nations police officers with Colonel Reese to meet with Brigadier General Ruak, who refused to do so in the belief that the presence of more police officers wearing blue shirts would aggravate the situation.	3
The Government acknowledged the attack and offered compensation to the victims.	4
The press conferences, in particular the first press conference, as well as the interrogation of the first suspect, and the arrest of former prominent security officials as proposed by the Committee, all had a catalytic effect.	1
The Council and the troop- and police-contributing countries heard briefings by the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Edmond Millet, the Deputy Military Adviser, Abhijit Goha, and the Acting Police Adviser, Andrew Carpenter.	4

Thirty-three of those killed were killed by regime forces, including 82 children and 48 women, while the Islamic State killed 17 people.	1
78. Most States of the subregion have been subjected to terrorist attacks either in their territories or against their nationals in other parts of the world.	1
The potential logistical support to the electoral process will have significant support implications, particularly in non-conflict-affected areas where the Mission has reduced its presence.	2
Following the Committee &apos; s approval, in September 2008 the Executive Directorate led a joint Committee/CTITF mission to Madagascar.	2
These individuals were identified by eyewitnesses who witnessed them participating in an attack on a village, during which arson, looting, murder and sometimes rape were often committed.	1
:: Regular coordination between the civilian and military components of missions and with humanitarian actors to consolidate expertise in the field of protection of civilians.	2
The purpose of the special meeting was to take the first step towards raising regional awareness of the sanctions regime and promoting enhanced cooperation between the Committee and the countries of the Sahel and the Maghreb region.	2
391. The looting of villages, the seizure of livestock, crops, household belongings and other personal belongings of the population by Government forces or militias under their control is undoubtedly a war crime.	1
As the militias of these groups maintain close links in the region, I expect the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to engage constructively in this process.	2
One battalion and sufficient resources are required for a headquarters to: secure the Kalimi airport; provide a secure environment for the electoral process; monitor the arms embargo at the airport and ports on Lake Tanganyika-Moba; prevent the movement of armed elements from South Kivu to Katanga; monitor Mayi-Mayi in northern and central Katanga and encourage them to join the integration process, or disarmament, demobilization and reintegration; and provide evacuation capacity for MONUC and other United Nations personnel in northern Katanga and Kasais.	1

Throughout the reporting period, Ambassador Gennady Tarasov, High-level Coordinator, focused his activities on the task of building confidence and bridges of cooperation between Kuwait and Iraq with a view to enhancing their active involvement in the search for missing persons and property and encouraging them to make clear and concrete progress towards the implementation of the objectives set out in paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999).	2
Most States have anti-money-laundering legislation and four of them include the financing of terrorism in their legislation as a predicate offence.	2
"The Security Council encourages national Governments, the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations to expand and deepen civilian expertise in peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict, including in countries with experience in peacebuilding or post-conflict democratization, paying particular attention to mobilizing the capacities of developing countries and women, as this is critical to the success of the United Nations in its peacebuilding endeavours.	2
The use of home-made explosives demonstrates the resilience of Al-Qaida-related terrorists in countries that effectively implement the arms embargo.	1

Kinshasa and other areas in the west of the country have experienced relatively low levels of threat, although crime rates remain a source of concern.	3
While there is a well-founded concern about the weakening of sanctions or the appearance of 'Line &apos; vis-Ã -vis terrorism, improving de-listing procedures will enhance sanctions while making them fair.	1
There was an intense oral argument between Colonel Reese and Mr. Malik.	3
On 2 May, the Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and the Legal Counsel, Nicolas Michel, briefed the Council on his recent trip to Lebanon and urged Council members to address the need to fill the vacuum and assist in the establishment of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.	4

216. On the basis of the findings of the Commission and the Lebanese investigation to date, the material and documentary evidence gathered and the evidence obtained to date, there is consistent evidence of Syrian and Lebanese involvement in this terrorist act.	3
However, in cases of crimes committed regularly or on a large scale, as a pattern of criminal conduct, the responsibility of the President becomes more serious.	1
Reaffirming the need to use all means, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, to combat threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts,	3
However, that should not divert attention from the full implementation of resolution 1559 (2004) and other Security Council resolutions concerning Lebanon. The implementation of those resolutions remains the best way to ensure Lebanon &apos; s long-term prosperity and stability as a democratic State.	2
The Council intends to intensify its efforts to combat impunity and to support accountability for serious crimes against women and girls by providing appropriate means, and draws attention to the full range of justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be considered, including national, international and mixed criminal tribunals, truth and reconciliation commissions to be considered, including national and international criminal courts, mixed tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions, as well as national victim compensation programmes, institutional reforms and traditional dispute resolution mechanisms.	2
Recognizing the important contribution of the Council &apos; s arms embargo in combating the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons, in mitigating conflicts and in creating conditions conducive to the peaceful settlement of situations that threaten to disturb international peace and security, and recognizing also the contribution of the Council &apos; s arms embargo in supporting conflict prevention, post-conflict peace-building, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and security sector reform,	4

64. The concern of States and the Committee to maintain lists of ideologies despite the lack of impact appears to be evidence of a broader trend in the fight against terrorism to harmonize efforts to arrest and detain terrorists, in an effort to prevent others from becoming terrorists in the first place.	2
- In an increasingly globalized world, it has become easier for terrorists to exploit sophisticated technology, communications and resources to achieve their criminal objectives;	3
The Sudan is not targeting the United Nations because it is a genuine Member of the United Nations and is committed to the provisions of its Charter. It appreciates its efforts to achieve security, stability and development in the Sudan.

The Financial Intelligence Unit became operational in the early 1990s and was established by legislation to address the increasing problem of money-laundering by organized criminal groups. The legislation was amended in 2002 to deal with the suppression of the financing of terrorism, forcing "cash dealers" to identify their clients, maintain customer records and customer accounts activity for at least seven years after the closure of the account, and to report to the Financial Intelligence Unit on large cash transactions (over $7,000), suspicious transactions and instructions for the transfer of funds within or outside the country.	2
Develop multisectoral strategies to address gender-based violence, involving health, safety/security, law/justice and psychosocial sectors; organize local training to strengthen national skills and capacities to address gender-based violence.	2
I urge Lebanese leaders to resume and accelerate their discussions on the development of a national defence strategy and to make concrete progress in that regard; the final outcome of this process must be that there will be no weapons without the consent of the Government of Lebanon and no authority other than that of the Government of Lebanon.	3
18. The Directorate will work closely with the Tawer records and information management system software provider to update the structural programme of preliminary implementation assessments, reflecting the views of the Committee, the recommendations of the Directorate &apos; s experts and the proposals of Member States to reorganize the preliminary implementation assessments to store more detailed and comprehensive information on the status of implementation of resolution 1373 (2001).	2

Call upon all parties concerned to create favourable conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes and their local reintegration or resettlement.	4
Reiterating its strong condemnation of the attacks on the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and its call upon the Government of the Sudan to expedite the investigation of those attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice, reiterating also its call upon all parties in Darfur to cooperate fully with UNAMID, and reaffirming its warm condolences to the Governments of the dead and their families,	3

This resulted from the priority given to further reform of the police structure pursuant to the direction of the European Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina following Bosnia and Herzegovina &apos; s failure to reach agreement on their accession to the European Union.	3
- Terrorists must also be prevented from exploiting other criminal activities such as transnational organized crime, trafficking in illicit drugs and drugs, money-laundering and illicit arms trafficking;	1
Encourage United Nations peacekeeping and other relevant missions authorized by the Security Council, as appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, to support or establish local mechanisms to address housing, land and property issues.	4
In this regard, it should be noted that that development has largely been achieved thanks to Prime Minister GusmÃ£o &apos; s leadership capacity and the cooperation of political parties represented in Parliament, including opposition parties, which have indicated their willingness to assist in addressing such an important national issue.	2
Calls upon [the affected State] to facilitate international relief to mitigate the humanitarian disaster by removing all restrictions that could impede the provision of humanitarian assistance and providing access to all affected populations.	2

Statements by other witnesses emphasized the occurrence of summary executions of persons who committed theft in areas under the control of the Mouvement national de CÃ´te d &apos; Ivoire.	1
The Executive Directorate, on behalf of the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force working group on countering the financing of terrorism and with the support of several donor States and organizations, is also leading a three-year global initiative aimed at developing a common understanding of good practices against the exploitation of that sector in the financing of terrorism.	2
While increased international cooperation in the areas of law enforcement, intelligence and diplomacy, and improved border control systems in Member States, both contribute to making it more difficult for terrorists to travel, the way to successfully implement the sanctions regime lies in the accuracy of the details on the Consolidated List.	2
- To contribute, as appropriate, to the efforts of the Ivorian authorities to develop their police and gendarmerie capacities, in particular through training in crowd control, and to re-establish their presence throughout [the affected country].	2
Another State stressed the importance of a community-based approach, noting that families, communities and informed local institutions were the most effective defences against violent extremist ideologies.	4
Stressing that terrorism can be overcome only through a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and cooperation of all States and international and regional organizations to prevent, weaken, isolate and paralyse terrorist threats,	2

However, the Group of Experts has prepared a strong and credible report, thereby recognizing for the first time the extent of human rights violations committed in the last days of the brutal conflict in Sri Lanka, where at least 10,000 civilians have been killed.	1
Contrary to the rumours, there is no evidence that police officers, including those provided with weapons and uniforms by the Defence Forces, participated in the shooting.	1
27. In addition, many States have taken temporary measures to allow their officials to implement sanctions imposed by a Security Council list even before national verifications are completed.	2

The review process has confirmed that all individuals who, although not listed exclusively on this basis, are primarily known for their role in providing ideological justifications to newly recruited recruits or to a broader public base for Al-Qaida-related violence are included. This is despite the fact that penal measures themselves have little if not no effect on their main tool: connectivity and persuasion via the Internet.	3
151. On the other hand, while recognizing the benefits for law enforcement services of mandatory surveillance, others, such as the Working Group on Internet Governance, believe that a system of mandatory surveillance can violate fundamental human rights.	3
"The Security Council stresses the need to continue to take measures aimed at preventing and suppressing the financing of terrorism and terrorist organizations, reiterates the obligations of Member States in this regard, including the effective implementation of those measures, and recognizes the importance of the work of other United Nations entities and multilateral organizations, in particular the Financial Action Task Force.	2

After the battle, the Group obtained two (2) metal containers of ammunition and photographs of other ammunition containers, which the Group &apos; s sources claimed to have been provided by the State concerned.	2
Moreover, the gap between President Gbagbo &apos; s position and his ruling party, on the one hand, and those of opposition forces, on the other, remains acute.	3
61. There are a number of stabilization instruments and plans (the Government &apos; s Stabilization and Reconstruction Plan, the International Security and Stabilization Support Strategy and the Stability Islands), but there does not seem to be a common approach within the United Nations system itself.	2
It will also lay the foundation for an effective firearms control mechanism, which can assist the authorities in managing the possession of weapons.	2

This conclusion on Iraq &apos; s State responsibility, as subsequently noted, is based on its violation of the Law on the Grounds of War (Prevention of the Threat or Use of Force, Article 2 (4) of the Charter), and not on breaches of the Law of Time of War (Violations of International Humanitarian Law), which is the main focus of the decisions of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission.	1
3. Over the past six months, the worsening crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic has continued to affect Lebanon in a way that exacerbates political polarization and concerns that the unrest in the Syrian Arab Republic has negative implications for Lebanon &apos; s stability.	1
42. The Mission continued to perform all its operational tasks, including rapid reaction preparedness, force protection duties and knowledge of the situation in the vicinity of its camps.	1
Most importantly, accountability means reaching out to the country/society, after the conflict is over, to enable communities to turn their backs and move forward.	2
113. In the climate of terror of death squads, political representatives fear that their militants will be kidnapped and arrested.	1
The instructions to her followers are to launch attacks wherever they can.	1
The trial of General Sanogo is still at the pre-trial stage; the investigation into the killing of 16 Malian armed forces advocates in a camp in Diabale in September 2012 is under way and the summary execution of three Tuaregs in Djibok (Gao region) in February 2014 is under investigation, with four Malian armed forces soldiers still in detention.	1
33. On 16 September, MINUSMA and UNICEF screened the armed elements of the Arab Movement for Azawad (Coordination Council) and the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, based in Bir (Timbuktu Region), and found that five children between 15 and 17 years of age, as well as two young men, were likely to have been recruited while minors.	1
The terrorist networks formed in the conflicts that are now taking place can pose a threat for decades to come.	1
40. I also call on the leadership of Hizbullah to cease all efforts to acquire weapons and build paramilitary capabilities outside the authority of the State.	3
The FIU deals with its counterparts abroad, both directly and through law enforcement channels.	2
The Programme of Action contains concrete proposals to improve national legislation and controls, and to strengthen international assistance and cooperation, and calls upon States to address the special needs of children affected by armed conflict.	2
My Special Representative participated in both forums. On 16 August, the Secretary of State for Youth and Sports inaugurated the Youth Parliament (see S/2010/85, para. 105), which includes 130 young people (including 66 girls) between the ages of 12 and 17. They will be trained for two years in leadership and representative skills and will have opportunities for dialogue on policy issues affecting young people.	4
OSCE observers had observed constant fighting in many locations in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, where artillery and mortar shelling often affected residential areas and caused civilian casualties.	1
Notes the support of the parties to the Peace Agreement for the maintenance of the multinational stabilization force referred to in the declaration of the ministerial meeting of the Peace Implementation Conference held in Madrid on 16 December 1998 (S/1999/139, annex);	4
19. The reporting period witnessed a number of reports of alleged Indonesian military activities in the unresolved border areas of Ikosi.	1
Fighting crime, in particular organized crime and corruption, has proved to be a daunting task for the Kosovo Police Service and the judiciary.	1
Many Sudanese were imprisoned or forced to live in exile after the coup.	1
43. Experts of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) held discussions with the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research on programmes and activities that could be organized to support the effective implementation of resolution 1540 (2004).	4
(iii) Improved capacity of [national] authorities in [the area affected by violence], including national law enforcement agencies, the judiciary and the prison system, to provide the necessary security for refugees, internally displaced persons, civilians and humanitarian workers while respecting international human rights standards.	2
Following the above, on 15 May 2012, the President of the Republic issued Executive Decree PCM 014-2012 in the Council of Ministers, article 1 of which states that the official map issued by the Republic of Honduras, together with the limits specified in the system of territorial administration, shows that the municipalities located on the land border with the Republic of El Salvador, including: Ocotepeque, Sinwaba and Mercedes in the department of Ocotepeque; Kololaca, GuaretÃ¡, San Juan GuaretÃ¡, Piadolid, Labertod, Mapulaca, PeriÃ±a and Piraira in the department of Lemeira; San Antonio, Santa Lucia, Magdalena and Colomuncagua in the department of Intebuka; Santa Elena, Yarola, Morcala, Cabanias, Santa Ana Ana, Obatoro, Mercedes Oriental and San Antonio Norte, in the department of La Paz; Karidad, Aracena, Guascoran and Alianza in the province of Bali.	2
334. The following patterns were mentioned: first, during attacks on villages, there were deliberate attacks against women and girls, including mass rape; secondly, women and girls were abducted and imprisoned for several days during which they were repeatedly raped; thirdly, rape and other forms of sexual violence continued during flight as well as displacement, including when women were leaving towns and internally displaced persons sites to collect firewood or bring water.	1
However, as the public authority responsible for policy-making, the Government also has a responsibility to deal with critical problems that arise within or between institutions.	2
Attempts to launder funds or finance terrorist acts using new payment methods have already been detected, but States face difficulties in developing legislation and regulatory regimes that are suited to such rapidly evolving payment methods.	1
23. Scope of the arms embargo: The Committee requested the Coordination Group to work towards the preparation of a document containing the experience of States in dealing with the threat of civilian and improvised explosives.	2
Although there have also been attacks by rebel forces, the Commission has found no evidence of their widespread or systematic targeting of the civilian population.	1
3. Directs the Committee to transmit to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) all requests for listing and de-listing and proposed updates of existing information concerning section A ('individuals associated with the Taliban &apos;) and section B ('entities and other groups and institutions associated with the Taliban &apos;) of the Consolidated List, which was before the Committee for consideration as of the date of adoption of the present resolution, so that the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011) may consider those issues in accordance with resolution 1988 (2011);	2
The Government of Kuwait &apos; s claim for real property of a deceased prisoner shall not be accepted, as this is in fact a claim for the real property portion after the expiration of the time limit for the admission of the claims, and the secretariat shall be requested to inform the Government of Kuwait accordingly.	3
68. The views of officials on the effectiveness of terrorist training materials available on the Internet vary, as theoretical guidance, however complete and accurate, requires some practical training or experience to help overcome operational obstacles.	2
The parties informed the mission that they were convinced that the Ouagadougou Agreement had ended the armed conflict and that the ongoing political crisis could not be resolved through the holding of elections.	4
The reason for this is the charged political atmosphere at this very time: the judiciary was not very confident and criticized for the manner in which the investigation was conducted.	1
22. There have been no reports of deliberate killing of children by armed forces or groups.	2
Desiring to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the truth and to hold the perpetrators of this terrorist act accountable for their crime,	2
At the same time, despite the promises raised by the process of democratization, one should not forget that this is a very responsible phase in the history of the Middle East that requires the highest level of vigilance and hard work in order to exclude miscalculations and unpredictability for the future of the region.	3
"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the tense situation prevailing in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan States.	3
Uganda remains concerned about the humanitarian situation in Darfur.	3
The decision to expel humanitarian workers and silence others by threatening to expel, or attempts to restrict the freedom of movement of UNAMID, comes within the framework of this policy of limiting the monitoring capacity of the international community.	3
In a region that is complex and vital in the maintenance of international peace and security, the authorities face great difficulties and constraints in responding to the demands and aspirations of an enthusiastic people for reform.	3
Despite the remarkable progress we have made, the complex political, security and economic environment continues to pose significant challenges to the elected leaders charged with normalizing the situation in our country.	3
Equally disturbing is the information on the increase in tension between the Government parties and the opposition in the context of issues critical to the future of Kosovo, as well as the continued appearance of elements willing to resort to violence.	3
The Armenian side &apos; s arguments are particularly surprising in that it mentioned in the Security Council, which in 1993 adopted a series of four resolutions condemning the use of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its territory, and calling on the Armenian occupying forces to withdraw immediately, completely and unconditionally from all occupied territories in Azerbaijan (resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993)).	3
As I said earlier, double standards in addressing terrorism and terrorist groups is another important matter of deep concern and seriously undermines the international community &apos; s collective fight against terrorism.	3
Most people in the region rightly refuse to return to the status quo ante, since any truce based on such limited results cannot be expected to continue.	3
We can only express concern about the deteriorating security situation in areas that were previously relatively calm.	3
Not later than May this year, during the Council &apos; s discussion (see S/PV.6314) of the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) (see S/2010/169), we drew the attention of the international community to the fact that the situation in the province is far from stable and of particular concern.	3
Although there is much evidence to support this, the United States Government has never shown any intention of prosecuting Luis Posada Carriles for his terrorist activities.	3
Of course, we are deeply concerned about the situation in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States, given their geographical proximity to our country.	3
The imbalances in the overall voter registration rates between the regions should be a serious warning.	3
We condemn the repeated terrorist rocket attacks on Israeli civilian targets.	3
However, we would like to urge further efforts to follow up on information obtained from Member States as part of the counter-terrorism effort.	3
Unfortunately, such warnings have not been followed.	3
Finally, we should caution that it is not in the interest of international peace and security for the international community, including the Security Council, to use the plight of Arab peoples for self-interest and change in the system of government.	3
As these complexities and behaviour continue, which are completely contrary to what is required for a just solution, we must ask: How can we achieve a successful conclusion to the peace process in 2009? We believe that the responsibility lies with the Quartet and the Security Council to put in place a practical mechanism to address these issues, in a situation where one party repeatedly refuses to respond to calls and fulfil its obligations, and to engage us in a periodic process without an end in sight.	3
The resolution reiterates the importance of fulfilling those obligations and stresses that neither party should undertake any activity that is contrary to those obligations under the road map or prejudges final status negotiations.	3
We believe that the issue of supporting the legitimacy of the Government is important because of the existence of a causal relationship, legitimacy and the removal of resistance by informal actors and networks of the nature of the force in Afghanistan.	3
We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as it violates the most basic right to human rights: the right to life.	3
The report of the assessment mission points to growing concern about the humanitarian and economic impact of the crisis on the Sahel region.	3
The declaration of independence was rejected both at the time of its birth.	3
The report mentions a number of incidents, particularly in the security sector, which are of serious concern.	3
At the same time, all Somali stakeholders, in particular the Transitional Federal Institutions, must act in accordance with their promises to address the enormous political, economic and security challenges facing them.	3
Viet Nam is deeply concerned about the alarming deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
While we are pleased that more than 10 million Afghan voters have been registered, we are concerned that there has been insufficient voter registration in the southern and south-eastern parts of Afghanistan due to security concerns.	3
We are particularly disappointed at the very low number of returnees, the best indicator of the assessment of the situation in the Territory.	3
As the representative of Algeria had just pointed out, the draft resolution, which had not been adopted, contained a clear condemnation of all terrorist attacks against civilians and all acts of violence and destruction.	3
At times, in order to camouflage these facts, the military has been dizzying to send false messages that it is the official armed forces that are engaged in such violence.	3
We condemn the excessive use of force by the Israeli army in densely populated areas, which inflicts widespread suffering and losses on large numbers of Palestinian civilians, including children.	3
"The Security Council stresses that RCD/Goma will be held accountable for any extrajudicial executions, including among members of civil society or those held in its detention centres in Kisangani.	3
Taken together, these challenges constitute political pressures on Governments and have a direct and serious impact on peace, security and stability in the countries concerned.	3
In this regard, I would like to reiterate that, unlike some other known cases involving illegal and unfounded territorial claims, including under the fabricated pretext of caring for ethnic minorities, the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination and statehood has been recognized.	3
The impasse could increase political tensions and affect the growing atmosphere of confidence that prevailed following the elections and the inauguration of President Martelly.	3
For our part, we are directly linking the issue of legality with the holding of elections in preparation under the Joint Electoral Management Body.	3
"The Security Council reaffirms its condemnation of all targeted assassinations of Lebanese leaders, particularly since October 2004, and demands an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against representatives of the Lebanese people and institutions.	3
The Cuban delegation strongly condemns the attacks against Palestinian civilians and the general destruction caused by the Israeli occupying forces in the northern Gaza Strip, and we also call for an immediate end to those attacks and the urgent withdrawal of the occupying forces.	3
At this moment, Qassam rocket fire continues to be deliberately directed from Gaza against the civilian population, targeting innocent civilians and terrorizing them while sleeping in their tricksters, sitting in their living rooms, or taking their children to school.	3
I would also like to reiterate that the four members of the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste convicted of manslaughter in a shooting in which eight members of the National Police of Timor-Leste were killed in 2006, one of whom was pardoned and three of whom benefited from reduced sentences, have not yet paid the compensation ordered by the Court to the widows of the victims.	3
These positions are an indirect participation in the blinding of the positions of the Syrian Government on its territory and an irresponsible incitement to violence in all its forms, which would provide international cover for terrorist acts by armed groups against the interests of Syria and its people and Government.	3
Let us speak frankly: these reports from the press, human rights groups and civilians on the ground raise serious concerns about the nature and scope of the conflict.	3
The leaders of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government usually evade their responsibilities under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
One of those concerns must be highlighted, namely, the deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks and months.	3
I must inform you with deep concern once again today that despite the considerable efforts of UNAMID, the security situation in Darfur has not improved significantly.	3
The social and economic challenges facing Afghanistan are significant.	3
These regulations cover the financing of the campaign, electoral activities, public order, access to the media and misuse of government resources for political purposes.	3
Finally, the broad institutional, cultural, ethnic and spiritual diversity of societies that are currently undergoing profound historical change may lead to certain security tensions and concerns.	3
There is a real awareness of the challenges faced by each individual country.	3
"The rivalry between opposing political forces casts doubt on the country's recent democratic success and threatens its progress towards lasting stability" (S/2011/540, para.	3
In conclusion, the challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous, but we are making progress.	3
We are concerned about the deterioration of the living standards of the people as a result of the difficulties faced by the country in 2008, particularly as a result of the global food crisis and the damage caused by the hurricanes that struck the island.	3
But there was also concern that only a flash of hope in the Middle East and an escalation of violence and destruction were brought to bear.	3
I would like to stress, in particular, as indicated in the report, that the Taliban continue to pose a real threat to the reconstruction and stability of the country, and that the containment of that organization is crucial.	3
However, Afghanistan continues to face challenges in its quest for stability and development, and key challenges include the security situation, the worsening humanitarian situation, challenges related to the rule of law, human rights and continued violence, resulting in increased civilian casualties.	3
Fourthly, piracy off the coast of Somalia is an international problem that requires our collective efforts and contributions.	3
The Secretary-General cautions unequivocally that none of the eight standards have yet been fully met.	3
We strongly condemn this morning &apos; s brutal attack on the Imams Ali al-Hadi and Hassan &apos; s military mosque in Samarra, and we share the Iraqi people &apos; s anger at that crime. It is yet another deliberate attempt by terrorists to sow the seeds of discord and fuel sectarian conflict among the Iraqi people.	3
This means that separatists continue to blatantly flout international law and reject the universal principles of the Charter of the United Nations.	3
We stressed the tragic effects of such messages recently on other parts of the continent.	3
But there can be no mistake that my country is also prepared to resist its ever-lost declaration of independence, as long as a settlement is not on the horizon.	3
To date, there has been no improvement in the management of reform at the national level.	3
We raise the issue of violence in order to express our impatience with regard to finding satisfactory and urgent solutions to the enormous challenges to the unity of Iraqi society.	3
I am concerned that this parliamentary vote and the stalemate within Parliament could waste the gains made by Somali stakeholders and their partners with great difficulty.	3
In all those discussions, I am encouraged that I have discovered a convergence of views: we all wonder how much Liberia has accomplished since the end of the fighting in 2003, but everyone is fully aware of the magnitude of the challenges that Liberia continues to face, and that we are taking nothing as a last resort.	3
Given the limited jurisdiction of the Serious Crimes Unit and the failure of the Indonesian ad hoc court process, additional remedial measures may be required to achieve justice.	3
This is unacceptable and even contradicts the declared ban by anti-Government forces on the use of landmines.	3
In their public statements, Colonel Gaddafi and his family continued to threaten citizens with civil war and with the possibility of mass massacres if protests continued.	3
The Council condemns all attacks by local and foreign armed groups that threaten the population, peace and stability of the Central African Republic and the subregion, including the attacks on Birao by the Rassemblement des patriotes pour la justice et la paix on 19 July and 24 November.	3
The Israeli people, who had hoped that Israel &apos; s withdrawal from Lebanon -- which this Council ratified six years ago -- would bring security along its northern borders, found themselves exposed to ongoing rocket attacks by Hizbullah, which, day after day, reached even deeper within Israel &apos; s territory.	3
Attacks against national and international security forces, personnel of public institutions, humanitarian workers and representatives of States have increased, attacks against polling sites and threats against voter registration teams have increased.	3
This was illustrated by recent incidents of indiscipline in DIS, in particular the alleged killing of a civilian by a DIS commander in Farchana on 22 March.	3
We note that the continuing challenges facing the police in Timor-Leste should not be underestimated.	3
At the same time, my delegation believes that elected representatives of ethnic minorities in the Assembly, in particular Serb representatives, would achieve better results and greater benefits for their voters if they took a more participatory approach, rather than withdrawing from the Assembly whenever they faced a difficult situation.	3
We should not underestimate the threat posed by the destabilizing activities of Al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.	3
While neither side seems ready to return to war, there is a disturbing pattern of escalation and destabilization that could lead to a widespread confrontation that could endanger the lives of more civilians.	3
However, the situation within Kosovo today continues to be of concern to us.	3
Like the other speakers who spoke before us, and in line with the statement made by High Representative Ashton, we condemn the work that led to the death of Mr. Dzikovic and the wounding of several others during the protests in northern Mitrovica on 2 July.	3
We urge Israel to stop its military incursions into Gaza.	3
South Africa stresses that, given the magnitude of these challenges, a comprehensive strategy that includes security, humanitarian efforts, good governance and socio-economic development is required.	3
Recent developments in the region underscore the concerns that have long been expressed to the mission by its interlocutors.	3
Such acts are totally unacceptable and the Palestinian Authority must put an end to such attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice.	3
Through our previous discussions, Belgium shared the concern expressed by the Secretary-General at the threat posed by violence in Iraq to a society, institutions and political process in a state of vulnerability to date.	3
We call on the Palestinian Authority to do everything in its power to stop those attacks.	3
The Palestinians and Arab countries must give Israel the necessary and reliable guarantees of its security as a State.	3
Clearly, this was because the said States rejected his actions.	3
It is important that women, who are the first victims of violence in all its manifestations, be given a key role in peacekeeping and peacebuilding, which is most important and urgent, to do so in the conflict prevention process.	3
These actions are being taken despite the clear negative attitude taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and are a challenge to the United Nations and the Security Council.	3
Rather, they insist on treating the case as a secondary immigration offence.	3
I also say today what I said on 31 January (see S/PV.6710). It is unacceptable that the Council be prevented from assuming its responsibilities.	3
Despite the repeated condemnation of those inhumane acts by Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), which have become the source of hope for millions of victims of women and girls worldwide.	3
The second reason is once again to call upon the Security Council to take urgent and necessary action to stop the bloodshed in Syria.	3
In the face of this blatant threat to international peace and security, we hope that the Security Council will act without resorting to the double standards that have characterized its previous work in this regard, so that it can urgently and decisively adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria on behalf of the members of the Arab Group.	3
We are deeply concerned about the fact that violence in the Middle East continues to be perpetrated unilaterally against the other side, despite the clear expression of disgust by the international community and the Security Council about that situation.	3
We urge all Member States to take immediate steps to comply with the commitment contained in resolution 2036 (2012) to ban trade in Somali charcoal, particularly by those most active in this trade.	3
That is important to strengthen the Mission &apos; s capacity to provide genuine protection to the Congolese civilian population, who, as Mr. Doss emphasized, have been the victims of a clear humanitarian disaster and widespread violations of human rights, in particular acts of violence directed against women and children.	3
Actions that might diminish confidence in the outcome of the negotiations must cease or be detrimental to them, and must be reversed.	3
The blockade must be lifted immediately to allow the civilian population of Gaza access to water, labour, trade, medical care and education - that is, access to their basic needs.	3
My delegation remains concerned about the continuing deterioration of the security situation in Iraq.	3
We must reject any attempts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia.	3
We were prevented from even condemning the violence and supporting a peaceful plan developed by Syria's neighbours.	3
The intensification of the discourse on both sides, the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan, is a matter of grave concern.	3
Once again, Egypt calls for an immediate cessation of Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.	3
It clarifies issues that require attention and concludes - with the encouragement of Somali women - that the international community should raise gender equality issues, including with Somali leaders.	3
We are deeply concerned that the ad hoc process developed for this purpose has failed.	3
We have noted with concern the Secretary-General &apos; s assessment that many of the factors that triggered the 2006 crisis remain in society, making it vulnerable to instability.	3
We are all deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in Côte d &apos; Ivoire, as the Council may have witnessed in my statement earlier today.	3
It also affirms that Rwanda must use its strong influence to ensure that RCD does not take such action.	3
In accordance with these resolutions, this organ must demand that the United States Government immediately sentence Luis Posada Carriles for terrorist acts or extradite him to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which has been prosecuted for years by its judicial system.	3
Further efforts must be made by the Government of Haiti and international humanitarian organizations in the area of preventive activities, such as the provision of sanitation and clean water.	3
"The Council expresses deep concern at reports of an unusual and sudden influx of thousands of Misseriya to Abyei town and surrounding areas, which could bring about significant changes in the ethnic fabric of the region.	3
We urge Israel to abide by its obligations with regard to the population in the occupied territories.	3
However, failure to intervene effectively to restore stability in that country is indeed threatening the effectiveness of the international community as well as the enormous resources it costs.	3
Despite all efforts to restore peace and security, we remain concerned about the recent major setbacks in stabilization efforts in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
Furthermore, Chile believes that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contains only a condemnation of suicide attacks against civilians.	3
The Republic of South Sudan is deeply concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the border areas of both the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan.	3
"The Council notes with concern the challenges in the area of social and economic development, as there is a marked deterioration in the living standards of the vast majority of Haitians.	3
This is an international obligation that States must fulfil to ensure justice for the victims of these reprehensible acts.	3
In this regard, although the fight against terrorism is being addressed more seriously by the United Nations in general and the Security Council in particular, there is limited evidence of genuine joint efforts to create a greater international response to terrorism.	3
Our main concern in that regard is the fact that, for the report, none of the eight key standards has yet been fully implemented.	3
"The Security Council notes with deep concern the postponement of the first round of the presidential elections, which were scheduled for 29 November 2009 in accordance with the communiqué issued by the Permanent Consultative Framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement on 18 May 2009, which was endorsed by all Ivorian political actors.	3
Monitoring and identification of violations of the arms embargo and, where appropriate, targeted sanctions must be strengthened in order to reduce the potential destructive effects of that process in the Somali context.	3
The protection of civilians is a duty that has long been ignored in Somalia.	3
The dissident group of parliamentarians rejected the Garowe process and put forward a proposal for the date of the presidential election from July to 30 April this year.	3
However, it is unacceptable that Israel invokes its legitimate security concerns as justification for imposing measures that affect an entire people in an indiscriminate manner and in violation of international humanitarian law.	3
However, we are concerned that the main factor in decision-making is being undermined by a lack of political consensus.	3
A gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.	3
We are concerned that the security situation remains problematic.	3
We are concerned about the lack of political freedoms there.	3
In this regard, we would like to reiterate what we have said on previous occasions, namely, that the most serious challenge facing this investigation is the continued exploitation by some parties, in our region or beyond, of the investigations to jump to political conclusions that are not relevant to the requirements of the investigation and that are not based on evidence and firm evidence.	3
However, the security situation remains a cause for concern for all, although the number of security-related incidents decreased in December 2011 and January 2012, compared with the previous two months.	3
However, we are concerned about the reports of increased tension between the ruling and opposition parties.	3
But, as I said at the open Tuesday meeting, events must be viewed within its framework, and the Security Council will do nothing to contribute to a peaceful settlement when it condemns the actions of one of the parties and turns a blind eye to anything else that happens in the region.	3
At the same time, Cuba condemns suicide bombings and other acts against Israeli civilians, who are innocent victims of the cycle of violence driven by their Government's policy, and we also reject the use of these sporadic acts to question the legitimate self-defence exercise of the Palestinian people and to justify the widespread or selective activities perpetrated against the Palestinian population.	3
"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the humanitarian impact of the conflict on the Angolan people.	3
This Council should not be allowed to reward that strategy by addressing the response to terrorism rather than terrorism itself; it must be rejected, not satisfied.	3
In this regard, the Council condemns in the strongest terms the continuing threats and acts of intimidation against MONUC elements.	3
Let me begin by reiterating the European Union &apos; s deep concern over the situation in Somalia and the regional repercussions of its conflict.	3
However, concerns remain with regard to 2.3 million people still living in crisis.	3
We are concerned, however, by recent developments, with further tensions between community members and ISAF forces.	3
However, the situation remains a source of concern, given the long borders between our two countries, which are difficult to control.	3
The main Palestinian factions in Lebanon expressed concern about the incidents and distanced themselves from Fatah al-Islam.	3
The Council should call for an immediate cessation of all military operations in Gaza and the withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces from the area.	3
By considering initiatives that are practically equivalent to that strategy, the Council will only make terrorists bold and undermine the letter and spirit of the road map.	3
Ali Kushayb and Ahmed Harun were refused arrest.	3
The Palestinians must end the incitement of the public to violence and do their utmost to prevent militants from attacking Israel, thereby provoking an Israeli response.	3
We are confident that these groups will not be able to undermine the electoral process at the national level.	3
I spent four days in Afghanistan at the end of June to assess the humanitarian situation, given growing concerns about the difficult humanitarian situation and the issue of the protection of civilians.	3
The situation on the ground is also of humanitarian concern. The Secretary-General emphasizes that Iraq is going through a major crisis and states that the situation is deteriorating.	3
At the same time, Germany and the European Union have repeatedly condemned the terrorist crimes that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis in the past.	3
There is no doubt that the structure and development of public administration in Timor-Leste remain an important challenge and must be taken into account.	3
That makes the irresponsible threat speech of the Iranian leadership even more disturbing.	3
Under international law, Israel, as the occupying Power, is obliged to protect Palestinian civilians, especially children, and to preserve civilian property.	3
Improving this situation requires the enforcement of laws - in particular the law on the elimination of violence against women - that criminalize and punish violence and harmful practices against women and girls.	3
Last Sunday, on the occasion of the 21st anniversary of Hamas, Hamas leader Haniyah refused to remain in office until the internal division was resolved.	3
As long as we are discussing the development challenges facing Afghanistan, the recent incident justifies the bleak picture of the security situation.	3
In this context, the European Union reminds Israel of its obligation to ensure full and safe access for humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.	3
We regard Armenia &apos; s position as an open and direct challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.	3
In the view of the delegation of Togo, all these issues require urgent action to prevent the Sahel from falling into total insecurity, which would be very detrimental to its development.	3
At the same time, other key elements of this institution-building process are strengthening the rule of law by increasing the effectiveness, integrity and overall functioning of the judiciary, strengthening law enforcement institutions to reduce organized crime and ethnic violence and bringing all criminals to justice.	3
This will require a clear and, frankly, a special attitude from the United States of America.	3
At the same time, President Al-Bashir threatens the international community with vengeance and, consequently, with further crimes.	3
In the current situation, which is extremely difficult, we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike to prevent the escalation of the conflict and to begin implementing their obligations under the road map, in order to revive the prospects for peace.	3
Despite those challenges, we cannot fail to acknowledge that nearly 50 per cent of the Afghan people live in areas for which responsibility for security has been transferred to the Afghan security forces.	3
The humanitarian consequences of the continued violence in Iraq are a matter of grave concern to my delegation.	3
The time has come for the international community to take effective measures to protect and enforce the most fundamental rights of the Palestinian people and to break the vicious cycle of violence resulting from Israel &apos; s continued illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories.	3
All of this requires a strong war against the unarmed actors, whose presence poses a threat and an obstacle to the full exercise of sovereignty by the Afghan State.	3
We are disappointed, Mr. President, that despite your efforts and those of many others, the Council has not been able to condemn that brutal terrorist attack.	3
Despite these achievements, however, challenges to the Government &apos; s effective authority and control over its national territory still need to be overcome.	3
It is also indisputable that Armenia, as the occupying Power, bears direct responsibility for those crimes.	3
In that context, we remain concerned about the most vulnerable groups in Timor-Leste: the poor and the displaced.	3
It is part of a song that is constantly being repeated before this Council and that does not increase its validity. It ignores both Palestinian responsibilities and Israeli rights. It does not recognize the excessive difficulties faced by Israeli forces in trying to protect their citizens and minimize the harm done to the lives of Palestinians, while the terrorists they face do not pay more attention to the lives of Palestinians than to the lives of Israelis.	3
We note Israel &apos; s security concerns that it is obliged to continue its aircraft flights, in particular allegations of violations of the arms embargo established pursuant to resolution 1701 (2006).	3
Lack of land and jobs, as well as insecurity, prevent many returnees from stabilizing in their communities of origin.	3
The German Government strongly condemns these acts of violence.	3
Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would like to apologize for once again asking for the floor, for we felt that it would be inappropriate and counterproductive to ignore the comments made by the representative of Armenia and to try to mislead the Security Council from them.	3
The continuing plight and suffering of the Palestinian people continue to be a tragic reflection of the consequences of the refusal to implement Security Council resolutions and the failure of the Security Council to enforce its resolutions.	3
This political incident was strongly denounced through a press release issued by the office of President Ernest Bai Koroma, as well as by numerous press statements issued by political interest groups, including the General People &apos; s Congress, the People &apos; s Movement for Democratic Change, the Independent Media Commission, the Political Parties Registration Commission and the Good Governance Campaign.	3
We can go on to mention widespread poverty, problems in the management of natural resources, thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons, additional thousands of ex-combatants waiting for reintegration, unresolved security sectors, massive violations of human rights and many other threats that are likely to fuel a new conflict.	3
In that regard, we believe that the destructive action aimed at obtaining unilateral political benefits should be unequivocally condemned.	3
While Pristina and Belgrade strongly condemned the incident and demanded the arrest of the perpetrators, each side claimed that the other was responsible for provoking the incident.	3
We would also like to express our concern that the recurrence of such incidents could lead to an unstable situation in the region, which makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful solution to the Kosovo situation, acceptable to both parties.	3
Israel must refrain from unilateral actions in Jerusalem that would alter the status quo or undermine confidence.	3
In conjunction with intolerance and deep roots in the political and social life of the region, organized crime threatens the very foundation of principles and values that we are trying to instil in the new institutions that have been formed there, thus giving away our efforts.	3
As a result, the cut-off limit for security threats has been exceeded for many countries in Africa and beyond, including members of this Council, exposing their weaknesses.	3
The failure of any Member State to comply with its obligations under the Charter should have consequences, and the Sudan should not be excluded.	3
We believe that Somalia faces a challenge similar to that of the Marathon enemy, because the constitution must be finalized by 20 April and its adoption completed on 22 May.	3
The impunity of these high-ranking officers is unacceptable and prevents societies emerging from conflict from recovering in a sustainable manner.	3
The Afghan authorities and the international community must make it clear that such behaviour is unacceptable.	3
Pristina has so far rejected every initiative in that regard.	3
Although the President acted within his constitutional powers, she discussed with him concerns that amnesty decisions of 25 December 2009 might reinforce the impression of impunity.	3
The first, caused in a continuing humanitarian emergency, also threatened peace and stability in Haiti.	3
Greece therefore insists on the need to clarify the sixth preambular paragraph - urging the Council "to make progress towards the resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement" - as it should be reiterated that such negotiations should take place between the two communities.	3
In that regard, we would like to go further since then to say that we believe that the only way to improve security and stability in Somalia is to enable the Somali security forces to subdue the most notorious rebels and to enable the Government to expand its areas of authority as far as possible if peace negotiations fail.	3
In his report, the Secretary-General notes some improvement measures in all those areas, with the exception of the central issue of local governance reform and, in particular, decentralization, where progress is lacking.	3
Some concerns were expressed - shortly before many presidential candidates - about the integrity of registration.	3
In order to continue this struggle, it is imperative that the international community make a greater contribution and pay more attention to this important aspect of the fight against terrorism.	3
My delegation strongly condemns those acts of violence and extends its condolences to the family of the deceased pediatrician.	3
In contrast, the authorities in Belgrade must put an end to their obstructionist attitude, which prevents Kosovo Serbs from participating in Kosovo's public institutions, as the "filled seat policy" poses significant risks to the writing of Kosovo's history without the participation of Kosovo Serbs.	3
We are particularly concerned about the indiscriminate proliferation of weapons in Libya and beyond its borders as a result of the conflict.	3
We urge Israel to take further action to remove settlement outposts in accordance with the road map and to address the growing threat posed by settler extremism.	3
A larger United Nations presence is indeed vital, but in order for the added value of our Organization to be fully effective, sufficient funds must be provided for both staff and security, and Mr. Eide reminded us of this a few moments ago.	3
With regard to the military aspects of security sector reform, the Government indicated that it wished to rely heavily on bilateral aid for army capacity-building.	3
In this regard, we are particularly concerned about the continuing lack of progress in the areas of minority freedom of movement, sustainable returns and the related representation of minorities in government structures and in the public sector as a whole.	3
My Government acknowledges the many expressions of condemnation and anger that have resulted from this terrible incident, and we particularly appreciate the Security Council &apos; s swift reaction to this heinous crime.	3
In fact, given the history of foreign intervention, those directives would not only be in question for different sectors of society but could also exacerbate the problem.	3
Above all, our concerns related to the insistence of the Pristina authorities on implementing the so-called strategy for northern Kosovo in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which remains the main international legal framework for a settlement in Kosovo.	3
In particular, we wish to express our deep concern at the stagnation in Haiti &apos; s socio-economic development and food security.	3
However, we note that without a strong justice and security sector, developing peace and stability can be threatened.	3
The international community has clearly expressed its strong condemnation of those actions, through the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council and a group of friends in Syria, which have a large and wide participation.	3
The threat posed by terrorists, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade to the security and stability of Afghanistan is a real phenomenon that must be constantly addressed.	3
We condemn all terrorist acts committed in Afghanistan, particularly the most recent one against the Indian Embassy in Kabul, and express our condolences to the Governments and peoples of the affected countries and to the families and relatives of the victims.	3
The timely collection of objective, reliable and accurate information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to formulating the Council &apos; s responses, as well as to strengthening action to prevent sexual violence.	3
The genuine establishment of the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo requires the formation of an army and the establishment of an effective and democratic justice system and police force.	3
The international community, including through the auspices of the United Nations, should use diplomatic influence and provide technical assistance in such areas as political, security and justice sector reforms, the drafting of new constitutions, legal frameworks and electoral institutions and the holding of elections.	3
It calls for adherence to international law and for all parties to implement their commitments and the road map in order to realize the vision of two States living side by side in peace and security.	3
In the context of those conditions of massive disparities and political, economic and social marginalization, a process has emerged that seeks to change the prevailing system, seek to bring about economic and political changes and create alternatives that allow participation and open new spaces and means of expression, including in short demands on fundamental rights.	3
ISAF troops must fully implement their mandate with a view to eliminating the threats emanating from Afghanistan.	3
In the view of my delegation, in order to prevent the outbreak of new violence and to stabilize northern Kosovo, it remains essential that the reconciliation process be accompanied by policies aimed at ensuring the social and economic stability of the communities in a non-discriminatory manner.	3
The withholding of this level of funding will paralyse any Government, let alone an occupying Power. If these funds are not released immediately, this measure will threaten the State-building gains made by the Palestinian Authority, including the promotion of good governance for the benefit of the Palestinian people and the development of security forces that maintain law and order in the West Bank.	3
Mr. Le Long Minh (Viet Nam): Terrorism is a source of concern shared by all States Members of the United Nations and the international community as a whole.	3
However, the grave danger remains that, as a result of that decision - which violates the documents of the Bonn and Berlin Conferences - the country will face an explosive situation fraught with new armed resistance and internal divisions in power structures.	3
They do all of these things, and they then seek protection and security and put it as a mask for blackmail and further concessions.	3
Preventing illegal border crossing is vital in addressing terrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling.	3
Unless the Government addresses these issues, they can pose serious threats to the security and stability of Timor-Leste.	3
In order to avoid a new wave of violence, the parties and the international community must act immediately.	3
We strongly condemn these practices, which constitute a flagrant violation of international conventions and humanitarian laws and norms. We call on the international community, the members of the Quartet and all the actors to intervene immediately and resolutely to compel Israel to put an end to such actions, which pose a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East region. Violence can only result in violence, which could put the region in a spiral of difficulty.	3
In that regard, we are deeply concerned about the security situation in Afghanistan, which has deteriorated since last year as a result of the repressive activities of the remaining elements of the Taliban and Al-Qaida, inter-warlord disputes and the narcotics trade.	3
Somali leaders must work towards an open political process for those who are willing to renounce violent opposition.	3
The demands of UNMIK and KFOR for information were met with a standard response from the KPC Commander, who said that, under his limited powers, he could not provide additional information.	3
Although these contacts were constructive, direct negotiations without preconditions, in which the parties are expected to submit proposals for land and security within 90 days, have not yet taken place.	3
We urge the Government of Haiti to take firm action to prevent such violence and to ensure that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice.	3
The Russian Federation once again calls upon the Israeli and Palestinian sides to exercise restraint and a high spirit of responsibility and to renounce unilateralism.	3
I cannot stress enough the threat posed by the unavailability of military helicopters to the operational effectiveness of the Force.	3
Beyond the MINURCAT area of responsibility, other developments are also of concern.	3
Although the overall security situation has also remained calm and peaceful since Timor-Leste formally assumed full responsibility for security on 20 May, smuggling, trafficking and illegal border crossing should be seen as a cause for concern, as well as tensions related to the demonstrations that took place in Dili last July.	3
The lack of such participation will prevent progress in addressing important issues of public administration and will not make any progress in improving the image of Kosovo in the minds of the international community.	3
Despite our assessment that achieving a complete ceasefire is difficult at this time, I continue to believe that the international community must make its position clear: the need for an immediate cessation of hostilities and more credible efforts by Israel to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, while urgent efforts are being made to create conditions to halt such attacks.	3
The Court &apos; s Trial Chamber &apos; s decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of a Head of State on 4 March 2009 triggered a major public reaction and set hopes for peace and stability a new setback.	3
We are also concerned about the re-emergence of cholera, although the mortality rate appears to be declining slowly.	3
However, in 2007, following the issuance of the arrest warrants against Aaron and Cocheb, President Al-Bashir publicly refused to execute them, challenging the authority of the Security Council and saying that Aaron had done what he had ordered.	3
In this context, the Council reaffirms that the main cause of the crisis in Angola is UNITA &apos; s refusal to comply with the relevant basic provisions of the Lusaka Protocol, and reiterates its request that UNITA comply with its obligations to disarm and allow the extension of government administration to the territory it controls.	3
In describing that unfortunate incident, the President stressed that it was malicious and unacceptable and involved potential violence in the upcoming 2012 elections.	3
The MDC candidate has little or no access to the media in Zimbabwe; it is forbidden to campaign freely; and campaign buses and cars are reported to have been seized by the State, allegedly for illegal registration.	3
Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned about the current political stalemate in the formation of a new Government and the definition of a clear constitutional reform process.	3
We should acknowledge our great concern about the situation in Afghanistan.	3
On several occasions, we have appealed to the Council to take action to compel Israel to cease its military attacks, to ensure the protection of the civilian population and to cease all illegal punitive measures through which it causes a humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip.	3
Cuba once again comes to the Security Council to condemn and strongly condemn the complicity of the United States Government and its absolute responsibility for the release of this person.	3
Africans have clearly expressed their concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe.	3
The European Union is deeply concerned about the continuing cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the occupied territories.	3
President Al-Bashir took diplomatic reprisals against the Kenyan decision and threatened to impose economic and commercial sanctions.	3
In that context, we believe that it is important that the Security Council pay the utmost attention to the threats posed by fundamentalist and extremist religious organizations such as the Liberation Party and urge the Council to impose severe sanctions on terrorist organizations.	3
I must, with great concern, inform you of the escalation of criminal acts and attacks against United Nations and humanitarian personnel.	3
In addition, Israeli air violations of the Blue Line, in direct violation of resolution 1701 (2006), continued on a regular basis.	3
In this regard, we take note of the statements made by Kosovo &apos; s main elected representatives, who immediately condemned that crime and demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice.	3
The international community must therefore take the necessary action to prevent Israel from continuing its series of condemned destruction in Gaza and to affirm its rejection of all such Israeli practices, which are in violation of international law and international humanitarian law.	3
That has been a source of constant concern to us.	3
However, we also oppose and condemn extrajudicial executions.	3
We condemn all ethnically motivated acts and crimes committed in Kosovo.	3
However, we do not believe that sovereignty makes it imperative for the Security Council to stand still when Governments carry out massacres against their peoples, thereby threatening regional peace and security.	3
As the Prosecutor, I will face any judicial appeal by President Al-Bashir and other accused in court.	3
Azerbaijan &apos; s refusal to engage in direct negotiations with the elected representatives of Nagorny Karabakh is one of the main obstacles to resolving the conflict referred to by the representative of Azerbaijan.	3
The Secretary-General and his Special Coordinator for Lebanon have issued statements strongly condemning the criminal acts of opening Islam as attacks on Lebanon &apos; s stability and sovereignty.	3
The United States urges the United Nations and the Haitian National Police to redouble their efforts in vetting students.	3
When dealing with the situation in Haiti within the framework of the United Nations, almost all attention is always focused on so-called security issues, which in practice reduces the urgent attention required to the country &apos; s serious structural, economic and social problems.	3
With regard to the humanitarian situation, Guatemala is concerned that, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 20 million people in the Sahel region require humanitarian assistance, particularly in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad.	3
We are also concerned about the very high rate of unemployment and widespread poverty in the country.	3
However, we are concerned that acts of violence can cause a part of the population to remain away from polling sites in the south and elsewhere.	3
Since the beginning of the political impasse following the elections of 29 March, the Secretary-General has expressed his concern about the process and politically motivated violence.	3
In other areas, however, progress has fallen short of expectations and many challenges remain.	3
My Government believes that such acts are not only contrary to international law, but also undermine the concept of the rule of law, which is the key element in the fight against terrorism.	3
We challenge anyone to say that there is now one battle in any corner of the Sudan.	3
Romania reiterates that any act of terrorism is unacceptable and must be condemned.	3
The French authorities are deeply concerned about the continued deterioration of the situation in the northern Gaza Strip during the past week.	3
That disturbing pattern of activities is a serious concern that threatens to undermine the credibility of United Nations operations.	3
That is why we condemn terrorism.	3
"The Security Council remains deeply concerned about the security situation in the Central African Republic.	3
That is unacceptable and must be fully condemned, especially by the Security Council, using the means at its disposal.	3
The humanitarian situation in Somalia remains a major concern.	3
What everyone has to do is reject hard-line voices that find comfort in the old ways and believe that it is impossible for Serbs and Albanians to normalize their relations by reaching a historic compromise.	3
The situation along the Lebanese border with Syria remains worrying.	3
"The Security Council also expresses its concern at the growing tensions in the Ituri region and calls upon all parties to exercise restraint.	3
Blue Nile State also remains a source of concern to us.	3
The United Nations counter-terrorism bodies should therefore address those shortcomings more seriously and with dedication.	3
Indeed, Azerbaijan itself is in violation of those resolutions, which urge the parties concerned to continue negotiations within the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group, as well as through various contacts among them.	3
She expressed the Council and the Secretary-General &apos; s deep concern at the recent increase in tensions between the North and the South, as well as the continued lack of progress on Abyei and other post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement issues.	3
The Russian delegation notes with deep regret and concern the information on the continuing violence in Darfur.	3
I am deeply concerned about the recent escalation between Gaza and Israel.	3
Clearly, these conditions represent the single biggest obstacle to stability and progress in Afghanistan and, if allowed to continue, threaten to disrupt the progress achieved in nearly three years.	3
Security and stability remain a major challenge.	3
However, the Operation has also demonstrated the magnitude of the challenges that Liberia &apos; s security sector continues to face, particularly with regard to logistics, communications and the mobility of the police and the Immigration Service.	3
Pakistan is deeply concerned by the report &apos; s finding that the humanitarian and economic challenges facing the Sahel have been exacerbated by the consequences of the Libyan crisis.	3
In particular, we condemn any attempt to force UNMIK into any kind of so-called joint rule, as well as any interference with the individual authorities of the Special Representative.	3
We note that civil society organizations have expressed serious concern in this regard.	3
It is clear that all law and order institutions in Iraq face serious challenges.	3
Political pressure on UNMIK has increased significantly with attempts to challenge its role under resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework.	3
There is no doubt today that the real intention was to prevent the public dissemination of the details of his reckless acts of destruction committed under the orders of the United States Central Intelligence.	3
The Government also shares a number of concerns expressed in the report on, inter alia, human rights and the situation of women and children.	3
We have serious concerns about that law, which can have far-reaching consequences.	3
However, we believe that a sudden withdrawal will be counterproductive and will create an unprecedented vacuum, especially in view of the fact that the conditions conducive to hoped-for investment, broad-based investment and sustainable development have not yet been fully established.	3
At the outset, I must express our serious concern about the security situation in that country.	3
I must say that the theme chosen for our debate today is a major challenge, although it is a matter of interest.	3
As the report of the Secretary-General (S/2004/634) makes clear, addressing the problem is a difficult challenge.	3
However, my delegation notes with regret that the security situation continues to give rise to concern.	3
I urge Hamas to respond to those appeals.	3
He reiterated his personal condemnation of the incident, which he described as giving the wrong and undesirable messages before the 2012 elections, and which would undermine and hinder the gains made in reshaping the image of the country and in building and consolidating peace, which had been achieved with strenuous efforts, with the assistance of our development partners and the international community.	3
Sadly, the current Palestinian leadership has proved unable to be a partner in peace as it is unable to pursue the reform and democratic governance of its people.	3
First and foremost, security concerns remain critical.	3
It is clear that the conditions for the implementation of this mechanism are not in place in the case of Darfur.	3
First, while Sierra Leone is the most advanced member of the West African Coast Initiative, the slow pace of progress elsewhere is hampering the exchange of intelligence and early warning.	3
France strongly deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint.	3
The political debate is likely to be protected and consolidated, with numerous electoral-related judicial appeals already filed.	3
The report confirms the disturbing picture of the situation in the Sahel region and the related security, economic and humanitarian concerns.	3
Secondly, Mr. Covic expressed his concern about the quality of democracy in a place where the minority - Kosovo Serbs - risk losing to the mechanical majority vote, and I would like to say that I believe that the most important aspect of democracy that can be expected is one &apos; s participation, exercise of democratic rights and vote.	3
We express our deep concern at the plight of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.	3
In Egypt, we have been calling for the peaceful and early transfer of power to a civilian Government.	3
The situation of minorities remains a matter of concern, particularly with regard to freedom of movement and access to justice.	3
Once again, we condemn the killing of civilians on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides.	3
The challenge of establishing local and regional administrations in areas recovered from Al-Shabaab must now be given high priority.	3
We urge the parties to act with restraint and avoid provocative actions or statements that would trigger further violence.	3
The United States urges the Haitian authorities to fulfil their pledge to fill all six vacancies in the Supreme Court by 3 October 2011.	3
We are concerned that the success of the presidential elections may run the risk of being eroded by the lack of progress in the formation of the Government.	3
The challenges facing the country demand that Haitian leaders have a common and unified will.	3
However, the prospect of a complete breakdown of law and order, as well as the collapse of the fragile economy and the disintegration of Palestinian self-government institutions, remains.	3
The negative impact of the Libyan situation, which poses a threat to continued peace and stability in the region, will grow, and China expresses its deep concern in this regard.	3
It remains a matter of great concern to me that the efforts of Liberians to rebuild their judicial system will take time, and therefore the system itself is likely to remain weak and vulnerable in the short term.	3
In 1993, that vision was at best blurry, and at that time it was impossible to determine the ultimate goal that would be close to responding to the concerns of both peoples.	3
We have noted the caution shown by the Secretary-General and the technical assessment mission with regard to security sector reform, in particular with regard to the National Police of Timor-Leste.	3
As I have made clear, I am confident that the Council will not be filled with these false accusations, which are at variance with the right and minimum standards of professionalism.	3
We have taken note of the concern about the implementation of the joint communiqué of 2 April 2009, referred to in the report.	3
This has raised serious tensions with local communities, as well as threats to MONUC by some former CSCE military commanders who are now integrated into the Congolese army.	3
We consider any departure from that principle unacceptable, let alone that the fragile situation in the region may lead to widespread instability.	3
Haiti &apos; s political and civil society leaders continue to rise to national consensus in key areas, such as the national budget, education, recovery and development priorities, elections and constitutional reform.	3
The Jordanian Government stresses the need for the Israeli Government to cease all acts of violence and destruction in the Gaza Strip and throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, put an end to the policy of destroying Palestinian infrastructure and homes, cease extrajudicial killings and impose collective sanctions on the Palestinian people and put an end to the violations being committed by Israel against them.	3
However, we remain concerned that there is too much focus on visits to developing countries.	3
As the United Nations Support Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), we would be irresponsible if we did not appeal to the international community, the Government of Pakistan, the Government of Afghanistan and its national forces to end that situation, particularly on the southern border.	3
Unfortunately for Hizbullah &apos; s actions, and as I said Israel has the right to defend itself, the use of excessive force must be condemned.	3
The new democratic Government of Pakistan has inherited a terrible legacy of political, economic and security challenges.	3
Further development in this direction could jeopardize efforts to reform and build the country and, in the long run, threaten peace and stability throughout the region.	3
The situation in Syria is a source of deep and growing concern to the United Nations.	3
We are particularly concerned about the lack of middle-level training of civil servants, as well as the significant problems that remain in the judicial sphere.	3
The recent decisions of an Indonesian Court of Appeal to repeal four criminal judgements of the ad hoc Human Rights Court, while falling outside the mandate of the Mission, directly affect the larger issue of accountability for crimes.	3
I am particularly concerned about the instability that could arise if the political and socio-economic situations continue to deteriorate.	3
However, there is a need for the will of the United States to place Middle East peace in its priorities, going beyond the disregard and absence that has lasted for almost seven years and has exacerbated the situation in the region.	3
We are also concerned about the situation of those involved in the reconstruction of the country.	3
We are deeply concerned about the insistence of leaders of groups such as the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) on refusing to participate in the talks.	3
The Council condemns all unilateral acts aimed at creating facts on the ground that would prejudice the outcome of the negotiations.	3
The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, as well as those who have been instructed to commit such acts, will be held accountable.	3
Such statements as "the Palestinian people do not love their children" or "the Palestinian people send their children to death because of their hatred of Israel" are racist and reflect the kind of attitude that should be rejected altogether - and I am trying to do so now.	3
To blame each other, to find a scapegoat responsible for failure in Afghanistan and to demand that those who are already doing so work the most unfair and unacceptable practices that will ultimately be a factor of psychological defeat.	3
We cannot send a message that terrorists will be safe, but only the usual convictions.	3
The recent advisory opinion of the Council of Scientists condemning drugs and other related activities could be very useful in discouraging opium poppy production.	3
We therefore urge the members of the Council and the Group of Friends of Haiti to give positive consideration to these recommendations made by the Secretary-General.	3
It seems that peoples not only aspire but also demand that pluralistic and more representative Governments provide tangible benefits to their citizens.	3
Timor-Leste continues to face important challenges in reducing poverty and creating employment opportunities, particularly for its young population.	3
The Council demands that the Government of the Sudan withdraw immediately from the Abyei Area.	3
Security sector reform remains one of the major challenges to long-term peace and stability.	3
Uganda believes that ending impunity is the only credible deterrent to crimes of serious concern to the international community.	3
We are deeply concerned that if not all sides exercise a strong will to stop acts of terrorism and violence, the peace process will not succeed.	3
We note that in his report (S/2008/728), the Secretary-General expresses concern about the security situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.	3
Azerbaijan is deeply concerned about the continuation of illegal settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.	3
We are therefore disappointed that the Secretary-General &apos; s report (S/2011/540) recommended only a partial reduction in the increase in troops.	3
Now, what Afghanistan has achieved is being eroded by serious challenges to the country &apos; s security and stability.	3
While piracy off the coast of Somalia remains a critical challenge, we call on the international community not to lose sight of the fact that the solution to that problem must be achieved on land rather than at sea. A comprehensive solution to the Somali conflict must address all the root causes of piracy and other challenges, including the exploitation of marine resources and the dumping of toxic waste.	3
The second point I would like to highlight today is our continuing concern for the well-being of the innocent population in Gaza and in towns and cities in southern Israel.	3
Finally, the Afghan leadership must combat drugs.	3
I also condemn Hizbullah &apos; s reckless contempt for the wishes of the elected Government of Lebanon and for the interests of the Lebanese people and the wider region.	3
"The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks that took place in Algiers on 11 December 2007, near the Supreme Court and United Nations offices, resulting in a large number of deaths and injuries, and expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of this heinous act of terrorism and their families, and to the people and Government of Algeria.	3
I also remember how unacceptable it was for the Israelis to talk about the 1967 borders and for a long time it was almost inconceivable to propose the evacuation of Israeli settlements.	3
The recent report of the Secretary-General on resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) clearly expressed the importance of disarming Hizbullah and ending arms smuggling across the Lebanese-Syrian border.	3
I condemned the terrorist attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.	3
We are concerned about the increase in insurgency activity in some areas of Afghanistan.	3
Today &apos; s debate is on an urgent issue.	3
It was important to formally prosecute cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse in accordance with the new Criminal Code.	3
States cannot flout this fundamental obligation without any consequences for their unlawful conduct.	3
My country has repeatedly expressed its concern about the civilian population in that area, and considers it important that MONUC be deployed there to protect them.	3
The incident in northern Mitrovica has clearly demonstrated that EULEX, despite the Security Council &apos; s mandate with regard to the reconfiguration of UNMIK, is increasingly moving away from the principle of neutrality towards status, thus undermining the existing international presence.	3
