# The Devil is in the Details: Assessing the Effects of Machine-translation on LLM Model Training and Performance

Conflict scholars increasingly rely on computational tools to track violence and cooperation at a global scale. To study foreign locations, researchers often use machine translation (MT), but rarely evaluate the quality of the MT output or its consequences on model performance. Using a multi-lingual parallel corpus, this study evaluates the quality of different MT tools for text written in English, Arabic, and Spanish.  Using ConfliBERT, a domain-specific model, we test the effect of MT variations on model performance, and find that MT texts tend to yield better results than native texts.   The analysis shows considerable quality variation across MT tools and reveals distortions in the output related to verbs, nouns, lemmas, and vocabulary rarity. Regression analysis at the sentence-level further shows that MT-induced data loss boosts model performance.
